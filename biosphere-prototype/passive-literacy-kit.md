# Passive Terrain Literacy Kit – Pattern Recognition for Civic Field Use

## Overview

This kit provides a set of low-tech, field-ready tools for observing terrain patterns.
It is intended for educators, scouts, civic planners, and ecological monitors.

Modules are portable, easy to use, and adaptable across different environments.

## Kit Components

### [`Moss Pattern & Moisture Memory`](./notes/moss-indicators.md)

* Identify moisture zones and shade patterns through moss growth
* Use for terrain entry checks and ground condition mapping

### [`Bird Clusters at Edges`](./notes/bird-mapping.md)

* Observe bird group behavior at habitat edges
* Detect early warnings, movement corridors, and phase disruption

### [`Ant Density and Direction`](./notes/soil-activity.md)

* Use ant trails to identify soil stability and avoid void-prone ground
* Simple indicator for safe navigation and slope checks

### [`Human Trace Patterns`](./notes/trace-memory.md)

* Recognize past land use through vegetation alignment and path flattening
* Useful for mapping old infrastructure, fence lines, or orchard grids

## Use Cases

* Field teaching in public green spaces and rural terrain
* Scout programs and outdoor youth training
* Early-stage civic land planning or public access prototyping
* Passive survey work by non-specialists

---

## Method & Requirements

* Observation only; no tools or sensors required
* Suited for informal, low-impact field use
* Compatible with notebooks, photos, or voice logs
