# 🏛️ Civic Core

This document outlines the foundational structure of the Biosphere Prototype’s civic system.  
It is not a legal charter, manifesto, or governance contract.  
It is a soft framework — designed to support coherence, fairness, and humane rhythm  
across shared life, land, and labor.

Everything here is updateable. Nothing is final.

## 🌱 Foundational Pillars

1. **Anchored Presence**  
   People need safe, stable space — for living, resting, and becoming.

2. **Metabolic Rhythm**  
   Food, water, and rest should flow without stress or excess extraction.

3. **Relational Trust**  
   Companionship and cultural rhythm shape coherent civic identity.

4. **Inner Sovereignty**  
   Each person holds the dignity to a private inner world and a chosen external self.

5. **Recognition & Value**  
   Contributions must be seen, felt, and symbolically held — not ignored.

6. **Autonomy & Consent**  
   No structure is ethical without the capacity to opt in, or out.

7. **Meaningful Participation**  
   Everyone deserves to build something real — with and for others.

## 📡 Feedback & Realignment

All systems drift. All rhythms break.  
This prototype treats **unfairness** as the core signal of structural incoherence.

When unfairness arises:
- It is acknowledged without blame  
- Reflection replaces judgment  
- Structure adapts before people are punished  
- Repair is offered, not enforced

The goal is not perfection — it’s *recoverable coherence*

## 🧠 Governance & Identity

We do not rely on fixed roles or rigid hierarchies.  
Instead, we hold:

- [**Guardian Kernel**](../public/EFS/guardian) (Ambient Guardian Interface) – a soft civic logic layer for reflection and synthesis  
- [**Personal Imprinted Companion**](../public/EFS/nmcc-shell) – an interface seeded to your rhythm, not assigned by structure  
- [**Group Intent Fields**](../public/EFS/examples/CohereFrame) – shared direction, not orders  
- [**Signal Stacks**](../public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md) – civic pulse and coherence signals from data-guided public feedback loops

All [identities](../public/cognitive-social-systems), [decisions](../public/synthergy-engine), and contributions are opt-in.  
This prototype values presence over compliance, rhythm over force.

## 📚 Boundaries & Conflict

Civic incoherence often begins at the [boundary](https://github.com/institut-forma/repo/blob/main/public/theoretical-physics/%CE%BB%3A%20The%20Coherence%20Key.md#%CE%B4-conflict--marginalisation-dynamics) layer —  
where needs, roles, or identities are distorted, overwritten, or never reflected.

This prototype recognizes:

- Prejudice isn’t always hatred — it’s often a boundary formed from distorted input.  
- Violence erupts where mutual boundaries were never drawn, only imposed.  
- Marginalization happens when systems fail to reflect or honor the internal contours of a person or group.  
- Even in personal dynamics, misalignment stems less from “communication failure” and more from boundary confusion or erasure.

We treat **boundary literacy** as foundational to civic health.  
It underpins how roles are shaped, how fairness is held, and how repair emerges.
