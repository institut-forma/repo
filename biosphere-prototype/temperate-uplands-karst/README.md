# Biome Thread: Temperate Uplands (Karst Mosaic)

This file documents the biome structure currently supporting our fieldwork.  
The template applies to [temperate upland karst biomes](./notes/temperate-upland-karst-biome.pdf) with forest–pasture mosaics and layered land-use memory.

---

### Who This Is For

- Biosphere management staff and local field teams  
- Civic prototype designers  
- Educators using land as curriculum  
- Scouts and equine handlers  
- Anyone working on terrain-based coherence models

---

## Natural Advantages

- [Stable seasonal transitions](./notes/seasonal-flow.md)  
- [High edge-density](./notes/edge-ecology.md), suitable for observation  
- Supports [foot, horse, and low-tech mobility](./notes/mobility-modes.md)  
- Biodiversity trace and ecological pattern memory present

## Known Risks

- [Tick activity](./notes/tick-mapping.md) during spring + early summer  
- Dry-crack trail zones in summer: [ankle/hoof injury](./notes/terrain-footing.md) risk  
- [Interference zones](./notes/soundscape.md): echo pockets, reception gaps  
- [Poisonous flora](./notes/plant-toxicity.md) in unmanaged zones

---

## Why This Biome

- Access year-round without major disruption  
- Existing land-use history with stewardship overlaps  
- Mixed-use terrain supports observation and presence  
- [Shared characteristics](./notes/translocal-fit.md) with similar global upland karst zones

## Domain Overview

| Domain        | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| [Terrain](./notes/terrain-folds.md)       | Karst ridges, forest folds, stone shelves |
| [Soil](./notes/soil-types.md)          | Quick-drying calcareous topsoil, deep moss pockets in shaded zones |
| [Water](./notes/springs.md)         | Springs and seeps, most active late winter through spring |
| [Flora](./notes/flora-edges.md)         | Deciduous-conifer blend, fruit tree remnants, pasture bloom |
| [Fauna](./notes/fauna-signals.md)         | Roe deer, fox, rabbit trace, stable insect web | 
| [Equine Fit](./notes/equine-interface.md)    | Compatible with Schwarzwälder Kaltblut and similar breeds |
| [Wind / Air](./notes/airflow-nodes.md)    | Predictable valley flow, cold dusk pockets, echo spill in forest edge |
| [Soundscape](./notes/soundscape.md)    | Spring crescendo, mid-summer silence, echo in valley lines |
| [Trace Memory](./notes/trace-memory.md)  | Abandoned orchard rows, fence shadows, flattened access paths |
| [Hazards](./notes/terrain-hazards.md)       | Thorn zones, hollow folds, visibility drops in underbrush |

---

## Spotting Before Entry

- [Moss pattern and moisture memory](./notes/moss-indicators.md)  
- [Sound behavior](./notes/soundscape.md) in tree breaks or hollows  
- [Sharp light/shadow contrast](./notes/microclimate.md): map microclimates  
- [Old fence, straight paths, orchard ghosts](./notes/trace-memory.md)  
- [Ant density and direction](./notes/soil-activity.md)  
- [Bird clusters at edges](./notes/bird-mapping.md)

---

## Equine Logic

Draft breeds like the [Schwarzwälder Kaltblut](./notes/equine-interface.md) are a match for this terrain.  
They are stable, low-compaction, and align with forest–pasture rhythms.  
Used for civic mobility, quiet field access, and multispecies integration.

Optional future layer: [semi-wild reintroduction](./notes/rewild-equine.md) in unmanaged pastures, to support passive landscape maintenance and re-cohering disrupted zones.

## Phase Signature

| Layer           | Reading |
|----------------|---------|
| [Seasonal Rhythm](./notes/seasonal-flow.md) | 4-phase stable |
| [Noise Profile](./notes/soundscape.md)   | Low-interruptive |
| [Human Tension](./notes/trace-memory.md) | Trace visible, no current rupture |
| [Species Cohesion](./notes/fauna-signals.md) | Edge-biased, mid-tier strong |
| [Civic Fit](./notes/civic-roles.md)       | High |
