# Terrain Footing & Seasonal Risk  
*Movement Cautions for Foot, Hoof, and Wheel in Karst Biomes*

Karst trails change with weather, not just wear.  
Footing shifts with freeze-thaw, dryness, and biological cover â€” and risk shows up differently in each season.

## 1. Spring â€“ Saturated Ground & Loose Debris

- Snowmelt = high moisture + unstable surfaces  
- Trail edges may collapse or slide  
- Roots exposed, moss becomes slippery  
- Water channels form across footpaths  
ðŸ¡’ *Use: waterproof boots, test each step with pole, walk mid-trail.*

---

## 2. Summer â€“ Dry-Crack Zones & Loose Rock

- Topsoil hardens â†’ cracking, detachment, ankle traps  
- Heat lifts dust â†’ obscures uneven footing  
- Dry pine needles = slip hazard  
- Loose scree on slopes sharpens risk for hoof slips  
ðŸ¡’ *Use: padded hoof boots, watch contour lines, slow on open slope.*

## 3. Autumn â€“ Leaf Cover & Hidden Instability

- Leaves mask cracks, holes, and slope angles  
- Wet leaf mat = slide risk  
- Mushrooms, rot = soft spots underfoot  
- Decomposing roots shift ground integrity  
ðŸ¡’ *Use: high-friction soles, listen for hollow thud under step.*

## 4. Winter â€“ Snow, Ice, and Edge Memory

- Thin snow crust hides sinkpoints  
- Ice pockets in shaded dips  
- Meltâ€“refreeze zones create sudden transitions  
- Hooves can ball with ice or catch  
ðŸ¡’ *Use: winter shoes with traction, route along sunlit ridge where safe.*

## 5. General Mitigation

- Scout first with light load  
- Log hazards in seasonal trail notes  
- Adjust expectations by season â€” same trail, different shape  
- Carry wrap, compress, and hoof care gear year-round

ðŸœ‚ Movement is memory.  
If you log where it slipped â€” next time, you know where it holds.
