# Terrain Folds â€“ Karst Ridge Behavior

## What to Look For

- **Limestone ridgelines** with fractured tops
- **Forest folds**: where tree cover tracks a moisture crease
- **Stone shelves** that interrupt slope â€” useful or treacherous
- **Collapsed sink points** often overgrown, unstable
- **Layered slope logic**: dry above, sponge zone below

---

## What It Means

- Steep = not useless â€” itâ€™s often where coherence hides
- Water moves laterally â€” flat doesnâ€™t mean safe
- **Slope tension builds phase drift**: erosion, wind load, snow creep
- Folded zones create **edge concentration**: plant diversity, animal passage, acoustics

---

## Field Behavior

- **Camp** above moisture fold, not below â€” avoid night damp + sink chill
- **Scout trails** along contours, not just cardinal directions
- **Watch trees**: lean shows wind memory, root flare shows soil hold
- **Mark tension ridges**: they often signal slide risk or echo chambers

---

## Design Implication

- Infrastructure must breathe with the fold, not cut across it
- Build where the land already **slows** â€” shelves, terraces, elbows
- Avoid forcing roads where water would drift â€” they wonâ€™t last

ðŸœ‚ A fold is where two stories meet â€”  
walk carefully, and you might hear both.
