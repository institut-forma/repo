# Civic Interface Roles â€“ Coherence-Compatible Participation Guide

## Overview

This note outlines **optional, post-stabilization roles** for human participation within a biome-managed upland karst field.

A coherence-aware interface guide â€” written for when the field has settled, the herd is self-regulating, and the terrain has begun to remember itself.

## Who This Is For

| Role Type                        | Contribution                                                 | Gains                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Local stewards**               | Terrain observation, path memory, water edge check-ins       | Belonging, ritual of place, legacy care     |
| **Educators & field guides**     | Teach pattern literacy (moss, birds, ants, herd logic)       | Curriculum rooted in living systems         |
| **Mobility designers**           | Light-signal trail observation, equine interface prototyping | Quiet movement infrastructure               |
| **Health & ecology researchers** | Monitor tick decline, fungal resurgence, pollinator return   | Non-invasive field research access          |
| **Civic liaisons / funders**     | Offer support without altering terrain structure             | Transparent value tracking, systems insight |

## Participation Rules

* No unmanaged groups or events
* No temporary infrastructure (no signs, no boards, no fences)
* Enter only through pre-observed coherent edge zones
* Exit if silence changes, birds vanish, or herd shifts rhythm unexpectedly

ðŸ¡’ The land dictates what it can hold.

## Values Satisfied (When Done Correctly)

| Value              | Expression in Field                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence**      | All human roles deepen existing rhythms, not overwrite them |
| **Access**         | Gained through attunement, not entitlement                  |
| **Low friction**   | No cost to the biomeâ€™s own pattern                          |
| **Education**      | Built from terrain logic â€” no need for gear                 |
| **Symbolic trust** | Earned through continuity, not visibility                   |

## Entry Threshold

This file activates only *after*:

* Phase rhythm is stable (seasonal readings confirm)
* All terrain note signals are alive and interpretable
* Scout presence is minimal and non-invasive

ðŸœ‚ If any of these are unclear, pause and delay.
