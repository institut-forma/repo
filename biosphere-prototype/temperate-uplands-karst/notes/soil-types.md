# Soil Types â€“ Karst Biome Ground Logic

The soil here doesnâ€™t spread â€” it clings, collects, vanishes, or guards.  
Understanding how it behaves is key to planting, building, and avoiding invisible failure.

## Primary Soil Types

### ðŸª¨ Rendzina  
- **Where:** Thin soil over solid limestone  
- **Texture:** Shallow, stony, fast-draining  
- **Behavior:** Dries quickly, warms fast, low nutrient storage  
- **Field Notes:** Plants root shallowly; trees stress in drought.  
- **Use:** Light grazing, dry orchards, **never** tillage.

### ðŸ§Š Terra fusca  
- **Where:** Developed over dolomite or marl  
- **Texture:** Deeper clay loam, often reddish-brown  
- **Behavior:** Holds water well but slow to dry  
- **Field Notes:** More fertile but heavy; prone to compaction  
- **Use:** Shelterbelt planting, terraces, heavier pasture use

---

### ðŸŒ« Colluvial Pockets  
- **Where:** Base of slopes, old erosion paths  
- **Texture:** Mixed â€“ loam, stones, organic debris  
- **Behavior:** Unpredictable fertility, can be sponge or slick  
- **Field Notes:** Good for wild herbs, scrub, surprise mushrooms  
- **Use:** Minimal impact zones, scout planting, wild graze buffer

### ðŸŒ§ Sinkhole Fill  
- **Where:** Karst depressions (dolines), former sinks  
- **Texture:** Deep silty clay with organic layers  
- **Behavior:** Moisture-rich but unstable footing  
- **Field Notes:** Floods in spring, collapses when dry-cracked  
- **Use:** Avoid for permanent build; seasonal forage, water trap use

## What to Watch

- **Soil color shift** marks water flow or nutrient loss  
- **Cracks** show seasonal stress â€” time your movement  
- **Smell and feel** after rain = fungal or root zone health  
- **No worms?** Soil is probably stressed or too acidic

## Implication for Design

- Match **root depth to soil breath** â€” donâ€™t force deep planting in rendzina  
- Use **sloped clay zones for cooling structures**  
- Build **drainage paths first**, structures second  
- Test by boot and blade â€” feel the flex before you commit

ðŸœ‚ The ground tells the whole story â€”  
but only in layers.
