# Equine Reintroduction – Passive Biome Coherence Layer

---

## Overview

This file documents the rationale, structure, and benefits of reintroducing **semi-wild, phi-tuned horse herds** into unmanaged upland karst pastures to restore coherence in overgrown or phase-collapsed biotopes.

These are **not agricultural animals** — they are biome-integrated agents of motion, disturbance, and fertility.

---

## Purpose

Reintroduction enables:

* Passive brush control and edge reopening
* Rebalancing predator-prey field logic
* Seed dispersal and microbe web reinforcement
* Tick suppression via underbrush disruption and rodent cycle shift
* Regenerative corridor creation through rotational grazing patterns

🜂 Herds are not managed. They are **released in phi-ratio spacing** and left to spiral naturally.

---

## Why This Matters

In unmanaged zones, structural collapse becomes visible through:

* Overgrown mid-density brush (blackthorn, bramble)
* Closed forest edges blocking light and seed drift
* Microfauna imbalance — mouse and tick blooms
* Predator movement limited by dense undergrowth

Without large herbivore presence, **terrain rhythm fails.**
Horses reintroduce **paced disturbance**, allowing the biome to reset without machinery or extractive input.

## Herd Model: Fractal Structure

| Herd Ring | Horses | Radius | Function                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Core (0)  | 13     | —      | Genetic anchor, terrain memory vector      |
| Ring 1    | 21     | 2.0 km | Dispersal driver, moss pressure stabilizer |
| Ring 2    | 34     | 3.2 km | Brush control + signal amplifier           |
| Ring 3    | 55     | 5.2 km | Predator balancing + corridor shaping      |
| Ring 4    | 89     | 8.4 km | Edge pulse and biome membrane extension    |

Total horses: **212**
Spacing follows a **phi-exponential spiral (1.618^n)** — allowing for fluid herd overlap without forced clustering.

## Where to Place Herds

**Start with terrain that has stalled.**
Look for:

* Overgrown pasture zones no longer visited by deer
* Mid-altitude shelf zones where edge light no longer reaches the ground
* Slope-plateau transitions near collapsed trails or buried paths
* Fungal suppression zones — where moss and ground crust show drought or density strain

Herds should avoid:

* Active seep zones, wetland basins, or spring lines
* Areas with shallow soil over limestone fractures
* Existing sensitive recovery plots or rare-species microhabitats

🜂 Placement is not aesthetic — it’s **tension-aware**.

## Ecological Effects

| Layer        | Impact                                                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soil**     | Fertility boost, fungal and microbe web repair                 |
| **Plant**    | Choke species suppression, seed dispersal, corridor bloom      |
| **Insect**   | Dung beetle recovery, tick reduction, pollinator stabilization |
| **Bird**     | Nest density increase, predator pattern reinforcement          |
| **Predator** | Fox, owl, wolf vector re-balancing via herd-trail feedback     |
| **Water**    | Spring avoidance required; hydrology edge must be buffered     |

## Waste Logic

| Output                | Field Effect              | Note                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Manure                | Neutral to regenerative   | High cellulose content, low acidity       |
| Urine                 | Short-term pH spike       | Avoid seep zones; recoverable on rotation |
| Dung-based Seed Drift | Native flora regeneration | Long-range dispersal via coat and hooves  |

> “Where they move, the land opens.
> Where they rest, the biome breathes.”

## Deployment Guidelines

* **No fencing** — use terrain fold and natural corridor logic
* **No feed intervention** — births follow carrying capacity
* **Annual monitoring only** — check signs, not bodies
* **Allow drift** — don’t pin herds; let them negotiate boundaries over time

---

## Entry Condition

* Introduce only when unmanaged zones exceed passive maintenance threshold
* Minimum **3 spiral rings recommended** to avoid genetic stagnation
* Avoid placing herds near spring or seep zones without buffer ridge

## Observer Summary

This is **phase restoration by hoofprint.**
Done properly, the land learns again how to hold itself.
