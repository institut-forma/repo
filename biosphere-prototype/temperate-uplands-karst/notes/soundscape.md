# Soundscape & Interference Zones  
*Acoustic Pattern Mapping in Karst Uplands*

---

## 1. Why Sound Matters

- Movement makes noise â€” how far it travels depends on terrain.
- Animals, people, and even water respond to acoustic cues.
- Some zones carry sound too far. Others trap or cancel it.

---

## 2. Interference Zones (Echo Pockets)

- **Cave mouths**, stone corridors, and valley bowls can reflect and distort sound.
- Shouted words may bounce or double â€” disorienting when not expected.
- Wildlife avoids or anchors near these pockets.
- Can cause **false directionality**: you hear something, but canâ€™t tell where it came from.

ðŸ¡’ Use for passive monitoring â€” or avoid if coherence is required.

## 3. Silence Fields (Reception Gaps)

- Dips or folds in terrain can muffle or block both sound and signal.
- Often cooler, damper, and shadowed.
- Radio or GPS may falter â€” so do bird calls and insect buzz.

ðŸ¡’ Excellent zones for resting animals, but dangerous for radio-dependent navigation.

## 4. Listening Practice

- Pause regularly. Log sound profile every 500â€“1000m:
  - Wind tone
  - Insect density
  - Distant mechanical intrusion
- Use 30s ambient audio clips with GPS tags
- Compare morning vs afternoon â€” sound shifts with heat and air density

## 5. Structural Implications

- Build away from echo pockets if clarity is key.
- Place rest zones in silence fields â€” psychologically restorative.
- Use sound-blocking ridges as buffers for sensitive zones.

ðŸœ‚ You donâ€™t need a mic to map sound.  
You just have to **notice whoâ€™s singing â€” and whoâ€™s not.**
