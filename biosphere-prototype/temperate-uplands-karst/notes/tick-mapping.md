# Tick Activity & Field Mapping  
*Springâ€“Summer Vector Awareness for Karst Biomes*

Karst uplands support rich edge ecology â€” and with that, seasonal tick activity.  
This file helps anticipate, observe, and respond without fear or disruption.

---

## 1. Seasonal Pattern

- Tick activity begins early â€” usually March or April.
- Peaks mid-spring through early summer.
- Drops off in high summer dryness or at elevations above 1000m.

ðŸ¡’ Pay extra attention after rainfall or in shaded, humid zones.

---

## 2. Terrain-Based Risk Zones

- **High-risk**: forest edges, long grasses, leaf litter, livestock corridors
- **Medium**: trail edges, bush patches, moist transitional fields
- **Low-risk**: rocky outcrops, dry slopes, open ridge lines

---

## 3. Common Tick Types

- **Ixodes ricinus** (castor bean tick) is most common
- Vector for **Lyme disease**, **TBE (tick-borne encephalitis)**, and others
- Prefers shade, moisture, and host trails (deer, rodents, livestock)

---

## 4. Mapping Practice

- Scout trails and rest zones regularly during active season.
- Use white cloth drags (e.g. sock drag) in suspected zones.
- Maintain logs:
  `YYYY-MM-DD / location / density / weather / terrain note`

ðŸ¡’ Log clusters, not individual ticks. You're tracking *tendencies*, not totals.

---

## 5. Field Mitigation

- **Route planning**: favor dry ridgelines, avoid tall grass edges in spring
- **Gear**: gaiters, tucked pants, repellent-treated fabrics
- **Animal care**: daily checks for horses, dogs, and pack goats
- **Camp setup**: avoid nesting near leaf litter or rodent paths

---

## 6. Bite Response

**Removal**
- Use fine tweezers or tick card.  
- Grasp close to skin. Pull slowly and directly outward.  
- Disinfect bite site immediately.

**Keep the tick**
- Place in sealed bag or tape to labeled paper: date, location, body site.  
- Store for later reference in case symptoms develop.

---

## 7. Watch for These Symptoms (3â€“30 Days)

- Expanding red rash (bullseye or swelling at site)  
- Fatigue, fever, flu-like signs  
- Nerve pain, tingling, or muscle droop (especially face)  
- Joint pain or brain fog (late onset)

---

## 8. Treatment Logic (When Care Access Is Limited)

- Seek antibiotics **immediately** if rash or symptoms appear â€” early treatment is best.
- Natural supports: catâ€™s claw, knotweed, andrographis â€” helpful but not substitutes.
- TBE is viral â†’ **no treatment post-infection** â€” check vaccination ahead of exposure.

ðŸœ‚ Donâ€™t fear the landscape â€” just understand its rhythm.  
Ticks follow flow, moisture, and mammals. If you move with intention, youâ€™re already ahead.
