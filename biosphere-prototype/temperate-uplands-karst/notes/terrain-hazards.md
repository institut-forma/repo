# Terrain Hazards – Karst Biome Risk Topography

## Overview

This document outlines common terrain hazards encountered in temperate upland karst environments. These are not freak accidents — they’re **patterned risks** that scouts and equine teams must learn to feel before they see.

It’s about **field presence.**

## Primary Hazard Types

| Type | Description | Scout Response |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Thorn Zones** | Dense briar corridors, often forest–pasture boundary | Avoid rush-through. Let equine hesitate. Mark scratch patterns for others |
| **Hollow Folds** | Subsurface collapse pockets disguised by brush or moss | Tap-test. Look for moss depressions, uneven warmth, or dry-ring vegetation |
| **Visibility Drops** | Sudden underbrush density + light shift | Slow down. Use audio markers. Animal silence often pre-warns |
| **Stone Shelf Skidlines** | Thin rock layers hidden under leaf-moss | Approach straight. Boot heel tap to test. Avoid if diagonal slope present |
| **Slope Echo Chambers** | Disorienting reverbs, distorts voice and sound judgment | Pause speech. Use natural noise (bird, wind) to recalibrate |
| **Wet-Crack Compression Zones** | Dried paths that crack open with pressure post-heatwave | Pressure test first. Hooves or poles, not full body weight |

## Scout Tactics

- **Hoof Logic**: Horses sense tension zones. Let them adjust pace first
- **Sound Map**: Track echo shifts — they reveal structural changes
- **Tactile Test**: Palm or boot test when intuition flags false stability
- **Thermal Reads**: Cold spots in otherwise warm terrain often mean voids beneath
- **Snag Logging**: Thorns repeatedly striking same gear zone = terrain memory

## Avoidable Errors

| Mistake | Risk |
|---------|------|
| “Cleared line = safe” | May be rotted or tension-holding zone under canopy |
| “Faster through bramble” | Can collapse unseen burrows or hide stone traps |
| “Stone = dry = fine” | Leaf layer + thin stone = silent slide hazard |
| “It’s just quiet” | Silence often means predator pattern, burrow zone, or subsurface shift |

## Microclimate Risk Cues

- **Low zones**: Combine cold air, mold scent, and silence = potential sink pocket
- **Ridge wind corridors**: Sudden gust = dismount if unsure
- **Edge crossings**: Notice behavior change in animal or horse — it's sensing a domain shift

## Scout Memory Phrase

> “The land doesn’t hide what will hurt you.  
> It just doesn’t explain it twice.”

Train presence. Not paranoia.  
Feel before you see.  
And log what made you slow down.
