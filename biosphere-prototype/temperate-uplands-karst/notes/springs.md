# Springs & Seeps – Water Emergence in Karst Terrain

## Overview

Water in upland karst doesn’t stay visible for long.  
It travels deep, then bursts out in short pulses — usually just after freeze or heavy rain.

These emergence points — if mapped — become the biome’s pulse.

## Water Point Types

| Type      | Behavior | Seasonality | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Spring** | High pressure flow from subsurface channel | Peaks in late winter–spring | Often stable but not always perennial |
| **Seep**   | Low pressure, gradual surface ooze | Moist year-round if shaded | Great for small fauna, cool zones |
| **Runoff Ridge** | Temporary sheet-flow after rain | Summer storm or melt | Causes erosion if unmanaged |
| **Sinkhole Edge** | Water accumulates then disappears | Spring–fall | Unreliable source, sometimes toxic |
| **Dry Crease** | Dried former streamlet or moss path | Signs: moss line, soil shift | Good scout marker for past flow |

## Field Markers

- Look for **moss mats** in shaded rock cracks  
- **Animal tracks** cluster near seeps in late day  
- Sound changes — water may echo behind stone  
- Soil darker in repeated flow zones (even if dry)  
- Watch **lichen density** — high water = low crust

---

## Practical Use

- Avoid overuse — many springs cannot support large draw  
- Good for **rest zones**, **field refills**, **trail markers**  
- Use seep zones for **climate relief**, not basecamp  
- Never assume surface water = clean — filter always

## Design Implications

- Build *above* springs — never right on top  
- Consider seasonal **drying curve** before committing site  
- Use natural rock shelves to direct runoff away from build zones  
- Mark known emergence for next scouting season
