# Mobility Modes in Karst Uplands  
*Movement Logic for Field Use and Civic Prototypes*

This biome supports quiet, adaptive mobility â€” by foot, hoof, or low-tech wheels.

## 1. Terrain Suitability

- Ground is generally stable across seasons, except during snowmelt or after storms.
- Karst features like pavements, sinkholes, and shallow soils require attention.
- Traditional herding and forestry routes often remain intact â€” these are the best paths to reuse.

---

## 2. Foot Mobility

- Reliable in nearly all conditions.
- Ideal for scouting, monitoring, and low-impact passage.
- Allows for careful navigation across variable terrain: moss, stone, underbrush.
- Best during wet seasons when wheels can cause soil damage.

## 3. Horse Mobility

- Local breeds such as the **SchwarzwÃ¤lder Kaltblut** are well-suited to this terrain.
- Can carry supplies, equipment, or personnel over slopes and uneven ground.
- Lower erosion impact than wheeled transport when used with awareness.
- Grazing and watering needs align with biome flow.
- Opportunity exists to reintroduce semi-feral lines in ecological management roles.

## 4. Low-Tech Wheeled Mobility

- Suitable for dry seasons and hardpack paths.
- Carts, bike trailers, and small-scale logistics setups are possible on pre-existing routes.
- Soil compaction and trail widening are key risks â€” limit use and maintain path edges.
- Avoid creating new access lines unless absolutely necessary.

## 5. Design Notes for Civic Prototypes

- Movement-first thinking: sites should be placed with access in mind from multiple modes.
- Prioritize walkability and hoof access â€” these are sustainable and repairable.
- Use wheels where recovery effort is lower than long-term foot/hoof use.
- Avoid permanent road infrastructure unless repurposing legacy lines.

ðŸœ‚ Movement here isnâ€™t just transport â€” itâ€™s pattern tracing.  
Design mobility to preserve signal clarity, not speed.
