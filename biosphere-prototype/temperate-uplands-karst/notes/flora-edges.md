# Flora Edges – Vegetation Pattern Recognition

Learning how **plant zones shape behavior, access, and signal flow** in upland terrain.

## Layer Logic

| Layer        | Typical Types | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Ground       | Moss, nettle, early bloomers (e.g. primrose) | Signals moisture memory; low disturbance = bloom density |
| Shrub        | Hawthorn, hazel, blackthorn | Edge-zone anchors; fruit, thorns, and boundary memory |
| Mid Canopy   | Wild apple, service tree, young birch | Often marks former pasture or orchard zones |
| High Canopy  | Beech, spruce, pine, sycamore | Forest density affects light, echo, path decay |

## Seasonal Highlights

- **Spring**: Wild garlic (moist rich soil), early bloomers show soil heat  
- **Summer**: Dense bloom + insect hum = stability  
- **Autumn**: Fruit drops trace old foraging routes  
- **Winter**: Edge-line bones visible — structure returns

## Human Use Markers

- **Orchard ghosts**: spaced apple/pear trees = old homestead  
- **Coppice rings**: hazel/spruce in cut pattern = firewood past  
- **Pasture bloom**: dense clover, vetch, dandelion = ungrazed phase  
- **Worn paths through nettle** = human/animal repeat movement

## Design & Scout Logic

- Build *into* natural clearings — never force canopy loss  
- Mark bloom-rich zones for potential pollinator corridors  
- Avoid monoculture regrowth zones — low resilience  
- Map thorn lines as both defense + edge signal
