# Biosphere Prototype  
Tools for Civic Terrain Observation and Low-Strain Deployment

This folder contains field-ready models designed to support land-compatible,  
civically anchored activity within biosphere zones and mosaic environments.

Developed to align with UNESCO-MAB criteria:  
- Participation without disruption  
- Observation without extraction  
- Action without added strain

### Contents

- [`Scout Manual`](./scout-manual.md)  
  Terrain-adapted guide for identifying ecological phase boundaries, flora/fauna zones,  
  and human trace patterns. Non-invasive. Use with mobile, notebook, or voice log.

- [`Equestrian Scout Kit`](./equestrian-scout-kit.md)  
  Field gear logic for mounted operations. Modular for seasonal use.  
  Designed to integrate with civic youth work, trail mapping, or rural monitoring programs.

### Compliance & Safety

- Based on voluntary use  
- Legally covered under standard Vereinsaktivität (Unfallversicherung, Tierhalterhaftpflicht)  

---

### Usage

Can be implemented by:
- Biosphere managers or municipal partners  
- Local clubs, horse handlers, outdoor educators  
- Schools or cooperative shelters  
- Existing stewardship programs

🌀 Ready-to-use. No licensing fees. No external tech dependencies.

### Broader Context

These tools are part of a wider civic prototype effort —  
one grounded in the idea that systems can hold people better,  
without force, noise, or constant negotiation.

What’s here is simple.  
But the intention reaches further:  
to support ways of living that feel less extractive, less brittle —  
and more coherent by design.

If these tools fit into that hope — even a little —  
we’re ready to adapt and grow them with care.
