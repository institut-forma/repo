# Scout Manual – Biosphere Boundary Survey

Field guide for mounted or ground-based scouts surveying land within a biosphere zone.  
Objective: Identify and document phase boundaries between terrain, lifeforms, and system layers without imposing artificial insertion.

## Observation Categories

### Terrain Feature
- **Observe:** Elevation changes, slope stability, erosion signs  
- **Why:** Identifies viable build zones, water flow, and risk areas  
- **Document:** Sketch contour, photograph transitions, mark GPS location  
- **Mobile Method:** Use geotagged photos or short video sweep with voice annotation

---

### Soil & Ground
- **Observe:** Soil texture, depth, water retention, signs of compaction  
- **Why:** Determines suitability for growing, construction, grazing  
- **Document:** Photograph exposed soil or ground disturbance, collect sample if needed  
- **Mobile Method:** Log coordinates and soil notes in a notes app or field notebook

---

### Water Sources
- **Observe:** Springs, streams, damp zones, runoff paths  
- **Why:** Essential for wildlife, cultivation, climate mapping  
- **Document:** Photo series showing water clarity and flow direction, mark GPS  
- **Mobile Method:** Record short video walk-along with verbal notes

---

### Flora Zones
- **Observe:** Forest types, open grassland, juniper patches, orchard trees  
- **Why:** Indicates habitat zones, soil type, light levels, traditional use  
- **Document:** Wide-angle and close-up photos, record known species  
- **Mobile Method:** Use plant ID tools as needed (e.g. iNaturalist); annotate photos if species are confirmed

---

### Fauna Markers
- **Observe:** Scat, tracks, nests, burrows, visible animals  
- **Why:** Identifies territorial boundaries, biodiversity activity  
- **Document:** Photograph evidence, note time, GPS, track type  
- **Mobile Method:** Pair photo with short voice or text log noting context and freshness

---

### Human Traces
- **Observe:** Trails, fences, huts, litter, historical structures  
- **Why:** Maps current and past human activity, shared zones  
- **Document:** Visual record of site, note type and condition  
- **Mobile Method:** Organize by use type (e.g. “old trail,” “fence damage”), include GPS tag where applicable

---

### Wind & Airflow
- **Observe:** Wind direction, strength, temperature transitions  
- **Why:** Impacts shelter design, animal comfort, air movement  
- **Document:** Compass reading, wind direction and force notes  
- **Mobile Method:** Record verbal log or annotate map with wind vector notes

---

### Soundscape
- **Observe:** Birdsong, insect activity, silence, echo, mechanical noise  
- **Why:** Indicates ecosystem health, disturbance, balance  
- **Document:** Audio recording (30–60s) with time, weather, and location  
- **Mobile Method:** Voice note paired with GPS coordinates and ambient clip

---

### Anomaly Zones
- **Observe:** Disruptions in pattern, silence, unusual absence or overactivity  
- **Why:** May signal ecological stress, human interference, or system drift  
- **Document:** Record location, describe contrast with adjacent areas  
- **Mobile Method:** Image or video plus clear verbal explanation of observed irregularity

## Guiding Principle

> Scout to **remember**, not to claim.  
> Let coherence emerge from attention, not intention.

## Field Data Handling
- Group visual, audio, and written data by observation type or location cluster  
- Maintain clear file labeling for export, review, or cross-agent correlation  
- Prioritize accuracy and clarity over density — signal is more important than volume
