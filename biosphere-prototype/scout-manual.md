# Scout Manual – Biosphere Boundary Survey

Field guide for mounted or ground-based scouts surveying land within a biosphere zone.

**Primary objective:**  
Identify and document *phase boundaries* between terrain, lifeforms, and system layers  
→ without imposing artificial structure or stress.

## Observation Categories

### Terrain Feature  
- **Observe:** Elevation change, slope angle, surface stability, erosion signs  
- **Why it matters:** Influences water flow, structural risk, and movement design  
- **Document:** GPS + photo (wide and angled), sketch contour if needed  
- **Mobile Tip:** Geotagged video sweep + voice annotations = 90% coverage

---

### Soil & Ground  
- **Observe:** Texture, compaction, water retention, depth via root pull  
- **Why it matters:** Determines growth viability, mount safety, construction base  
- **Document:** Sample image, hand-drawn texture note, disturbance type  
- **Mobile Tip:** Note consistency across zones; log shifts as a pattern

---

### Water Sources  
- **Observe:** Springs, flow channels, pooled damp zones, dry beds  
- **Why it matters:** Habitat continuity, human use potential, climate insight  
- **Document:** Sequence photos (inlet → flow → outlet); clarity + sound if running  
- **Mobile Tip:** Narrate flow direction, time of day, last weather event

---

### Flora Zones  
- **Observe:** Tree types, patch transitions, fruit remnant rows, grass diversity  
- **Why it matters:** Reveals soil, sunlight patterning, former use, edge zones  
- **Document:** Layered photos (canopy → midline → undergrowth); mark dominant species  
- **Mobile Tip:** Confirm IDs if known; note if unrecognizable for later review

---

### Fauna Markers  
- **Observe:** Tracks, scat, feather/fur remains, nests, dens, sightings  
- **Why it matters:** Indicates territory, feeding lines, species interaction  
- **Document:** Close-up photo + print width/length; timestamp and location  
- **Mobile Tip:** Include context: trail proximity, freshness, behavior trace

---

### Human Traces  
- **Observe:** Old trails, fence remnants, structures, dumped items  
- **Why it matters:** Signals history of use, access tension, potential shared zones  
- **Document:** Wide + detail shots, condition notes, access path origin if visible  
- **Mobile Tip:** Mark use-type ("passive", "active", "abandoned") + GPS

---

### Wind & Airflow  
- **Observe:** Direction, speed, transitions, warmth/cold shifts  
- **Why it matters:** Affects shelter placement, scent lines, fire drift, temperature zones  
- **Document:** Draw arrow on map or photo overlay, include conditions  
- **Mobile Tip:** Note layered movement (e.g., “cold downhill draft, warm upper shelf”)

---

### Soundscape  
- **Observe:** Species calls, mechanical noise, echo, background silence  
- **Why it matters:** Indicates balance/disruption, flow state, or hidden stress  
- **Document:** 30–60s audio file + timestamp, weather, terrain type  
- **Mobile Tip:** Speak one tag word at beginning (“forest edge,” “insect lull”) for sorting

---

### Anomaly Zones  
- **Observe:** Sudden silence, absence of expected life, overgrowth, weird stillness  
- **Why it matters:** May signal ecological fracture, human contamination, or unknown drift  
- **Document:** Describe what changed and *how fast*; contrast with nearby norm  
- **Mobile Tip:** Keep tone neutral — don’t interpret too early

---

## Field Data Handling

- Sort data by *location cluster* or *category type*  
- Use consistent filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD_[zone]_[type]`  
- Prioritize **signal clarity over detail** — don’t overload with noise  
- If possible: compile daily scout dump → clean into structured archive within 24h

## Guiding Principle

> Scout to **remember**, not to claim.  
> Let coherence emerge from attention, not intention.
