# Scout Manual – Biosphere Boundary Survey

This is a practical field guide for scouts working on foot or horseback within a biosphere zone.  
The focus is on identifying meaningful transitions between terrain, living systems, and memory traces —  
without adding pressure to the environment by observing it.

## Observation Categories

### Terrain Features

Look for slope angles, elevation changes, loose rock, and erosion signs.  
These reveal where water moves, where weight holds, and which spots may not support infrastructure later on.

When possible, sketch contours, take angled photos, and mark GPS at transition points.  
Slower video sweeps with short spoken notes can help when sketching isn’t possible.

---

### Soil & Ground

Soil behavior changes fast across short distances — note changes in texture, firmness, or water retention.  
You can press a stick or your boot to feel compaction, or use shallow digging to test root presence.

Photograph exposed sections or disturbances, and write short notes on soil type and moisture.

---

### Water Sources

Watch for springs, seepage, seasonal runoffs, or dry channels that still leave signs.  
The presence or absence of insects often says more than the water itself.

If a spring looks blocked or dried, gently digging a few centimeters nearby may reveal flow.  
Record photos or videos following the flow path, and mention recent weather if relevant.

### Flora Zones

Scan for shifts in tree types, mid-height brush, or field-edge growth patterns.  
Old orchards or grazing plots often show up through tree spacing or fruit remnants.

Wide shots show zone transitions, while closer images capture species or leaf/bark traits.  
Use plant ID tools or flag unknown species for follow-up later.

### Fauna Markers

Scouting includes noticing where animals have already moved: scat, tracks, fur tufts, nest signs.  
The freshness of signs helps estimate frequency of use.

Photograph tracks with a reference object (pen, boot), and note location and context.  
Simple voice notes like “fox scat, forest path, east-facing, dry” are often enough.

---

### Human Traces

Look for trail forms, fencing, ruins, dumped materials, or recent cut lines.  
These point to active, abandoned, or informal use zones.

Try to document both wide context and the detail — it helps with identifying age and function.  
Sort by type (e.g. "old trail", "abandoned orchard wall") to reduce later sorting overhead.

---

### Wind & Airflow

You can usually feel airflow changes before you see them.  
Pay attention to how it shifts between open land, slope edges, or tree cover.

Recording wind direction with a compass or overlaid map helps later interpretation.  
Short clips showing leaf movement or speaking notes into the wind are quick and useful.

---

### Soundscape

Quiet listening tells you a lot about ecosystem stability.  
Record natural sound when possible — birds, insects, wind, silence, machine hums.

Include time of day and weather.  
A spoken note like “edge path, morning, distant echo from south” is enough for most clips.

---

### Anomaly Zones

Sometimes the most useful thing you’ll find is *what doesn’t fit*.  
Strangely silent areas, odd clusters of a single species, or sudden texture changes can signal system drift.

Describe what changed and how quickly.  
Revisiting the spot later helps you figure out if it was a shift or just a moment.

## Handling Field Data

- Sort your images, audio, and notes by either location cluster or observation type  
- Use consistent filenames: `DD-MM-YYYY_[zone]_[type]_[#]`  
- Prioritize clear, interpretable records — too much detail can create confusion later  
- If possible, review and tag your day’s data within 24h while your memory is still fresh

## Field Orientation

> Scout to **notice**, not to prove.  
> Let what’s coherent reveal itself by how it holds, not how it looks.

There’s no pressure to collect everything.  
Just be steady. The patterns show up when you let them.
