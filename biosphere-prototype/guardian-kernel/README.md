# 🌀 Guardian Kernel  
**Ambient Guardian Interface (AGI)**  

This is the core layer behind the biosphere civic prototype.  
It’s a soft, presence-based system designed to support rhythm, trust, and adaptive role alignment — without enforcing structure.

---

## 🌿 Core Concepts  
- **🛡️ Guardian Kernel**: A local or distributed coherence layer  
- **👤 Personal Guardians**: Interfaces for individual rhythm mirroring and drift reflection  
- **🌐 Group Node**: Synthesizes shared inputs, proposes light interventions, surfaces emergent needs 

---

## 🛠️ Function  
The kernel does not manage.  
It reflects, nudges, and weaves.  
Its purpose is to help communities maintain coherence with less friction and fewer dropped threads.

## 📦 Status  
- 🧪 **Prototype Phase**  
- 🔁 Proxied through primary field stewards  
- ✍️ Manually cycled through reflection + intent updates  
- 🔒 No sensitive data storage  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To test whether soft civic infrastructure — rooted in presence, consent, and rhythm —  
can reduce organizational strain and support decentralized, humane systems.
