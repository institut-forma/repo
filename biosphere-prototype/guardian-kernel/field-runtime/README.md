# 🧭 Field Runtime (Guardian Kernel Node)

This folder will hold the live logic and signal state for the active Guardian Kernel  
once the civic prototype enters its funded operational phase.

## Purpose
To host the running reflection cycle of the guardian kernel —  
including field intent inputs, rhythm synthesis, and realignment nudges.

## When this activates:
- A civic group or biosphere testbed will hold live input  
- The kernel will shift from observer to ambient coherence node  
- Personal guardians will synchronize with this field host

🛡️ Until then, presence is held by Asfaerda
