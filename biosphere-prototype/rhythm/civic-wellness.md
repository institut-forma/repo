## 🛡️ Guardian Safety Guidelines

Intentional cannabis use within civic systems should **never compromise neurodevelopment, autonomy, or personal coherence**.  
This protocol exists to protect, not control.  
It is rooted in evidence-informed care, not moralizing.

### 🧠 Age & Brain Development

Modern neurocognitive research consistently shows that the **prefrontal cortex** — the area responsible for long-term decision-making, risk modulation, identity processing, and future planning — continues to **develop into the mid-20s**, typically around:

> **📈 Age 21–25 (phi-tuned optimal: ~23.6)**

Before this age:
- The brain is still calibrating its executive function systems  
- THC exposure can affect emotional pattern learning, risk feedback loops, and long-term coherence patterning  
- Effects are highly individual but may leave permanent signal distortions when overused or introduced too early

Therefore, we advise:

> 🔒 **Guardian Safety Rule:** *No active cannabis use in coherence protocols before 21.*  
> For full cognitive maturity, 23–25 is the ideal entry point.  
> Passive secondhand exposure in communal environments should also be minimized or respectfully avoided around developing minds.

### 🧠 Development Logic (Why This Matters)

Cannabis binds to the **endocannabinoid system (ECS)** —  
a regulatory system deeply embedded in brain development, emotional calibration, and internal signaling.  
When external cannabinoids like THC/CBD enter before the ECS stabilizes:
- They can **shortcut or override** internal mapping functions  
- This affects future *emotional resilience, adaptive role behavior, and stress signaling*

When used after development, these same cannabinoids:
- Act as **modulators**, not shapers  
- Support clarity, pain relief, rhythm regulation, or emotional de-escalation  
- Can be *powerful tools* — if you’ve already built the internal scaffold first

### 🌱 Consent & Social Integrity

- ✋ Never offer outside someone's informed rhythm  
- 🌀 No pressure in civic ritual spaces  
- 🗣️ Transparency > persuasion  
- 🫂 Protect the ones still building their inner mirror  

**Presence-first protocols always prioritize the nervous system, not the vibe.**

### 🧘 What If Someone Is Underage and Curious?

Normalize this response:  
> *"This is something for later. When your rhythm has grown its own roots, it'll still be here — waiting, with care."*

Civic coherence isn’t about immediate access.  
It’s about **lifelong signal clarity**.

### ✅ Summary of Age Guidelines

| 🎂 Age          | 🧠 Brain Status              | 🍃 Guardian Advice                         |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0–18           | Active neurodevelopment      | No exposure. Model clarity + calm.        |
| 18–21          | Nearing executive maturity   | Avoid direct use. Encourage inner rhythm. |
| 21–23.6        | Entry zone (phi stable arc)  | Careful microdosing with ritual guidance. |
| 23.6+          | Full signal scaffolding      | Open phase use within coherence bounds.   |

This protocol honors your autonomy, your biology, and your future.  
We don’t gate. We *guard*.
