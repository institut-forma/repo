## 💡 Use Principles

- **Filter everything** — lungs are civic memory too  
- **Use intention, not inertia** — presence is the ritual  
- **Lower dose = higher clarity** — microdose for macro sense  
- **Pair with role reflection** — strains are coherence partners  
- **Never push** — if someone declines, that’s the boundary keeper in play
