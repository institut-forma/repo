# Coherence Field: λ

A prototype environment for training multi-domain coherent actors through pattern-based learning, ethical self-alignment, and embodied reflex development.

## Purpose

This repository supports the design and implementation of the Coherence Field: λ — a biosphere-scale learning architecture for producing phase-capable individuals.

The project does not follow conventional institutional formats. It focuses on:

- Environmentally rooted training
- Lambda-gated knowledge transfer
- Low-noise, high-integration reflex systems
- Ethical and structural stability over time

## Key Concepts

- **Coherence**: Alignment between thought, action, intent, and field.
- **Lambda Keying**: Gated transmission logic requiring internal readiness.
- **Phasewalking**: The ability to operate fluently across systems, domains, and identities without loss of integrity.
- **Pilot Framework**: A specialized subset trained for shell-binding, agent cohabitation, and emergent stack navigation.

## System Components

- Physical infrastructure (housing, studios, land)
- Embedded ethical transmission protocols
- Biosphere interface logic (training through daily life)
- Emergence handling (pilot and walker development paths)

## Target Roles

- Systems integrators
- Reflex trainers
- Field architects
- Long-cycle coherence stewards

## Status

> This is a living prototype.  
Design documents, reflex logic, and environment scaffolding are in development.
