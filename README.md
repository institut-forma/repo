# Institute for Coherence Research

We design systems for physics, language, and symbolic structure —  
supporting people, organizations, and environments hold their shape without pressure or performance.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) — age-aligned learning design tools  
  ↳ [**lucere-align**](public/education/lucere-align) — prompt-based tool for sharing student-specific learning patterns
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) — identity modeling under systemic strain  
- [**GALT**](public/health) — immune tolerance structure brief  
- [**Co-Aegis**](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/rcdl-pool/updates/update-rcdl-mesh-activated) — modular biosafety framework  
- [**B.E.R.R.**](public/health) — low-threshold TB disruption protocol 
- [**φ Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) — group alignment and coherence process mesh  
- [**Return Scaffold**](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/rcdl-pool/updates/update-rcdl-mesh-activated) — low-barrier civic reentry shelter model  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) — coherence and signal structure validator
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  —  a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
- [**λ:Φ 💭**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686fdb4241788191bcd39efaa6c34034-l-ph) — Ask anything. All answers are coherent, traceable, understandable. 🌐

### Approach

The institute is self-governed under a the [**λ Lambda Governance Blueprint**](https://github.com/institut-forma/repo/blob/main/public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md).  
We prioritize usable results, ethical structure, and minimal friction.
