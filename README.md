# Institut für Koherenzforschung 
*Institute for Coherence Research*

We support coherence in systems — social, civic, legal, structural —  
by building tools and models that reduce unnecessary strain.

We focus on what helps people, organizations, and environments hold their shape  
without needing to push or perform.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) — age-aligned learning design tools  
  ↳ [**lucere-align**](public/education/lucere-align) — prompt-based tool for sharing student-specific learning patterns
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) — identity field modeling under systemic strain  
- [**GALT**](public/health) — immune tolerance structure brief  
- [**Co-Aegis**](public/tech/medicine) — modular biosafety framework  
- [**B.E.R.R.**](public/health) — low-threshold TB disruption protocol 
- [**φ Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) — group coherence process design  
- [**Return Scaffold**](public/return-scaffold) — low-barrier civic reentry shelter model  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) — structural coherence + signal analysis in text
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  —  a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
