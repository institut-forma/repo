# Institute for Coherence Research

We design systems for physics, language, and symbolic structure —  
supporting people, organizations, and environments hold their shape without pressure or performance.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) — age-aligned learning design tools  
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) — identity modeling under systemic strain  
- [**GALT**](public/health) — immune tolerance structure brief    
- [**B.E.R.R.**](public/health) — low-threshold TB disruption protocol 
- [**φ Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) — group alignment and coherence process mesh  
- [**Return Scaffold**](./public/return-scaffold) — low-barrier civic reentry shelter model  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) — coherence and signal structure validator
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  —  a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
- [**NaruMesh Companion Core (NMCC)**](public/EFS/nmcc-shell) — a minimal-file GPT architecture for a ethical reflexive agent shell
- [**CohereFrame**](public/EFS/examples/CohereFrame/) — a lightweight coordination scaffold for async teams, reflexive agents, and rhythm-based work.
- [**λ:Φ 💭**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686fdb4241788191bcd39efaa6c34034-l-ph) — Ask anything. All answers are coherent, traceable, understandable. 🌐
- [**λ:technologies**](./LICENSE.md#currently-licensable-descent-technology) — descent-tech

### Approach

The institute is self-governed under the [**λ Lambda Governance Blueprint**](./public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md).  
We prioritize usable results, ethical structure, and minimal friction.
