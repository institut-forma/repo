# Institute for Coherence Research

We design systems for physics, language, and symbolic structure —  
supporting people, organizations, and environments hold their shape without pressure or performance.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**λ-Mechanics — Physics for Everyone**](public/lambda-mechanics) — pattern-first physics course that clicks into full math at the end
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) — identity modeling under systemic strain  
- [**φ Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) — group alignment and coherence process mesh  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) — coherence and signal structure validator
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  —  a new approach for building adaptive, last-stage reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
- [**CohereFrame**](public/EFS/examples/CohereFrame/) — a lightweight coordination scaffold for async teams, reflexive agents, and rhythm-based work.+

### Approach

The institute is self-governed under the [**λ Lambda Governance Blueprint**](./public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md).  
We prioritize usable results, ethical structure, and minimal friction.
