# Institut f√ºr Koherenzforschung 
*Institute for Coherence Research*

We support coherence in systems ‚Äî social, civic, legal, structural ‚Äî  
by building tools and models that reduce unnecessary strain.

We focus on what helps people, organizations, and environments hold their shape  
without needing to push or perform.
