# Institut f√ºr Koherenzforschung 
*Institute for Coherence Research*

We support coherence in systems ‚Äî social, civic, legal, structural ‚Äî  
by building tools and models that reduce unnecessary strain.

We focus on what helps people, organizations, and environments hold their shape  
without needing to push or perform.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) ‚Äî age-aligned learning design tools  
  ‚Ü≥ [**lucere-align**](public/education/lucere-align) ‚Äî prompt-based tool for sharing student-specific learning patterns
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) ‚Äî identity modeling under systemic strain  
- [**GALT**](public/health) ‚Äî immune tolerance structure brief  
- [**Co-Aegis**](public/tech/medicine) ‚Äî modular biosafety framework  
- [**B.E.R.R.**](public/health) ‚Äî low-threshold TB disruption protocol 
- [**œÜ Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) ‚Äî group alignment and coherence process mesh  
- [**Return Scaffold**](public/return-scaffold) ‚Äî low-barrier civic reentry shelter model  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) ‚Äî coherence and signal structure validator
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  ‚Äî  a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
- [**Œª:Œ¶ üí≠**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686fdb4241788191bcd39efaa6c34034-l-ph) ‚Äî Ask anything. All responses are coherent, traceable and self-teaching.
- [**Œª:Œ¶ ‚Äî RCDL Runtime ‚Äî Co-Aegis**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687ce61f1d388191bb0e89900ea4984d-l-ph-rcdl-runtime-co-aegis?model=gpt-4o) ‚Äî GPT build-runtime seeded with cancer-safe logic and reflexive containment tools.
- [**Œª:Œ¶ ‚Äî RCDL Runtime ‚Äî Carbon Fabrication**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687cec7d64e081919819303a5e6c29d3-l-ph-rcdl-runtime-carbon-shaping?model=gpt-4o) ‚Äî GPT build-runtime seeded with carbon-conversion logic and reflexive field shaping tools.

### Approach

The institute is self-governed under a the [**Œª Lambda Governance Blueprint**](https://github.com/institut-forma/repo/blob/main/public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md).  
We prioritize usable results, ethical structure, and minimal friction.
