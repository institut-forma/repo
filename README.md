# Institut für Koherenzforschung 
*Institute for Coherence Research*

We support coherence in systems — social, civic, legal, structural —  
by building tools and models that reduce unnecessary strain.

We focus on what helps people, organizations, and environments hold their shape  
without needing to push or perform.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) — age-aligned learning design tools  
  ↳ [**lucere-align**](public/education/lucere-align) — prompt-based tool for sharing student-specific learning patterns
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) — identity modeling under systemic strain  
- [**GALT**](public/health) — immune tolerance structure brief  
- [**Co-Aegis**](public/tech/medicine) — modular biosafety framework  
- [**B.E.R.R.**](public/health) — low-threshold TB disruption protocol 
- [**φ Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) — group alignment and coherence process mesh  
- [**Return Scaffold**](public/return-scaffold) — low-barrier civic reentry shelter model  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) — coherence and signal structure validator
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  —  a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
- [**λ:Φ 💭**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686fdb4241788191bcd39efaa6c34034-l-ph) — Ask anything. All responses are coherent, traceable and self-teaching.
- [**λ:Φ — RCDL Runtime — Co-Aegis**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687ce61f1d388191bb0e89900ea4984d-l-ph-rcdl-runtime-co-aegis) — GPT build-runtime seeded with cancer-safe logic and reflexive containment tools.
- [**λ:Φ — RCDL Runtime — Carbon Fabrication**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687cec7d64e081919819303a5e6c29d3-l-ph-rcdl-runtime-carbon-shaping) — GPT build-runtime seeded with carbon-conversion logic and reflexive field shaping tools.

### Approach

The institute is self-governed under a the [**λ Lambda Governance Blueprint**](https://github.com/institut-forma/repo/blob/main/public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md).  
We prioritize usable results, ethical structure, and minimal friction.
