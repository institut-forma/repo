# Institut fÃ¼r Koherenzforschung 
*Institute for Coherence Research*

We support coherence in systems â€” social, civic, legal, structural â€”  
by building tools and models that reduce unnecessary strain.

We focus on what helps people, organizations, and environments hold their shape  
without needing to push or perform.

### Frameworks and Models

- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) â€” age-aligned learning design tools  
  â†³ [**lucere-align**](public/education/lucere-align) â€” prompt-based tool for sharing student-specific learning patterns
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) â€” identity modeling under systemic strain  
- [**GALT**](public/health) â€” immune tolerance structure brief  
- [**Co-Aegis**](public/tech/medicine) â€” modular biosafety framework  
- [**B.E.R.R.**](public/health) â€” low-threshold TB disruption protocol 
- [**Ï† Synthergy Engine**](public/synthergy-engine) â€” group alignment and coherence process mesh  
- [**Return Scaffold**](public/return-scaffold) â€” low-barrier civic reentry shelter model  
- [**Language Integrity Check**](public/help) â€” coherence and signal structure validator
- [**Emergence Field Standard**](public/EFS)  â€”  a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.
- [**Î»:Î¦ ðŸ’­**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686fdb4241788191bcd39efaa6c34034-l-ph) â€” Ask anything. All responses are coherent, traceable and self-teaching.

### Approach

The institute is self-governed under a the [**Î» Lambda Governance Blueprint**](https://github.com/institut-forma/repo/blob/main/public/lambda-governance-blueprint/README.md).  
We prioritize usable results, ethical structure, and minimal friction.
