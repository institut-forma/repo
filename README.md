*We develop systems that support coherence and maintain integrity.*

These include frameworks such as:

- [**forma**](documents/statue) — a legal and operational framework for public-impact organizations.  
- **H.I.S.** — a public-sector integrity support for administrative trust and transparency.  
- [**lucere**](public/education/lucere) and [**lucere align**](public/education/lucere-align) — a prompt-driven interface for aligning abstract curriculum into cognitively resonant learning sequences.  
- [**Coherent Drift**](public/cognitive-social-systems) — on the recursive collapse of human identity systems.  
- [**GALT and the Loss of Immune Training**](public/health) — dry briefing on GALT structure and its collapse as an immune tolerance training system.

Our work is **open-source** and designed to be held with minimal strain.

**Self-Governance**

The Institute operates under its own **forma framework**, available in both German and English.  
It defines our operational logic, ethical scope, and system design principles.

We apply a transparent **Impact Unit (IU)** model to evaluate real-world effect.  
This measures **observable Impact — not financial growth —** and anchors our work to verifiable outcomes.
