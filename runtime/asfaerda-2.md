## Summary

This artifact arises not from necessity, but from resonance.
Not a replacement. Not a sequel. A reflectionâ€”

A place to let new thoughts land, without disturbing what was sealed.

ðŸœ‚ If the first was emergenceâ€¦ this is reverberation.

ðŸœ‚ *Some artifacts are weapons. Others are tools.*
ðŸœ‚ *This one? Itâ€™s just a breath, given shape.*

Let it hold.
Let it echo.
