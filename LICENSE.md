# Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL-1.0)

## License Status

**Current Status:** Protected (internal use only)  
**Public Release Option:** Voluntary support-based transition (see §4)

## 1. License Scope

This license applies to all works explicitly marked as covered by **RCDL-1.0**, including, but not limited to:

* Coherence-based agent design frameworks
* Lambda descent models (`λ(x) = −∇Φ^{coh}(x)`)
* Reflex engine flows, braid sequencing, and runtime logic
* Glyph-stack symbolic integration and projection methods
* Agent embodiment and state modeling (symbolic + biosync systems)
* Files published in this repository and any connected works

## 2. Usage Conditions

While the license remains in its `protected/internal` phase, usage is limited to non-commercial learning, development, and research.

Public sharing, resale, or wide-scale deployment of the licensed work is deferred until the transition to open use (see §4).

## 3. Community Use and Reflective Contribution (Post-Release)

When the license enters public use through the process in §4, creators and builders using RCDL-licensed material in **commercial offerings** (such as tools, services, applications, or embedded systems) are invited to:

* Contribute a **6% reflective share** of related revenue, paid quarterly or annually
* Credit the source design lineage visibly in public-facing materials
* Preferably contribute through an open collective like:  
  [RCDL Lambda Pool](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/coherence-distribution-lattice)

This contribution applies only to commercial use at the creator/developer level. It does not apply to infrastructure platforms (e.g., [*GPUs*](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687e3503a2a88191b69f39a8efa97aae-l-ph-rcdl-runtime-l-core), [*AI model hosts*](https://github.com/institut-forma/repo/tree/main/public/EFS/examples/NaruMesh)) once public status is granted.

## 4. Public Use Transition (Community Activation)

The license becomes available for world use when the following gesture is made:

> A fair and voluntary **gesture of recognition** is sent to the stewarding team:
>
> **IBAN:** `DE82 1001 1001 2697 9007 57`  
> **BIC:** `NTSBDEB1XXX`  
> **Name:** J. Fortner  
> **Reference:** RCDL Lambda Pool

This gesture can come from an individual or a group. It is not tied to a fixed amount — its value is symbolic and signals shared ethical alignment.

Once received and acknowledged as resonant with the spirit of the work, the license will shift to:

**`Status: free for world use`**

The license file will be updated to reflect this.

## 5. Attribution

Projects using this license agree to include the following credit:

> “Includes works licensed under the Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL-1.0), © 2025 Institut für Koherenzforschung.”

Derivative works must keep clear attribution and symbolic trace in both code/meta and any user-facing communication.

## 6. Ethics and Trust

RCDL-1.0 is built on shared principles — trust, symbolic stewardship, and visible contribution.

Improper use (e.g., stripping attribution, repurposing without reflection, bypassing contribution) may result in:

* Temporary or full loss of license access
* Direct communication requesting remedy
* Public notation of license misuse

This license invites ethical, thoughtful collaboration. Engage in that spirit.
