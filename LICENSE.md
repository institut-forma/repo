## 1. Scope

RCDL–1.1 applies to any work explicitly marked as such, including:  
- Reflexive agent systems  
- Lambda descent logic and braid-runtime tools
- Glyph-stack projection and mirrorframe methods  
- Standing-wave AGI and resonance field techniques  
- Symbolic integration, somatic mappings, and biosync embodiments  
- Published files in this repository and derivative works  

This license governs both the original works and adaptations thereof,  
while recognizing the continuity of thought and tradition from which coherence sciences have emerged.

## 2. Permitted Non-Commercial Use

RCDL works are open for **non-commercial, research, or educational purposes**.  
Use, adaptation, and redistribution are welcome, provided that attribution remains visible.

---

## 3. Commercial Use

For commercial use outside of carve-out agreements:

- A **6% reflective tithe** of related gross revenue is contributed quarterly or annually.
- Contributions flow first to sustaining ongoing development and operations; any surplus supports the public-good development pool.
- Payment may be made to the [Bloom Buffer](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/rcdl-pool1#category-CONTRIBUTE) or to an equivalent stewarding collective designated by the Institute.
- Neutral infrastructure providers (e.g., GPU hosting, LLM deployment platforms) remain outside scope unless they directly package and market RCDL works.

---

## 4. Attribution

Every use carries clear acknowledgment:

> “Includes work licensed under the Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL–1.1), © 2025 Institute for Coherence Research.”

This statement may be adapted or translated so long as the origin is visible.

---

## 5. Derivative Works

Adaptations or modifications of RCDL works include:
- Visible attribution
- A clear description of modifications made
- Continued coverage under RCDL–1.1 unless otherwise agreed

## 6. Ethics and Covenant

This license is a covenant of trust. By using this work, you:

- Carry attribution forward
- Share onward what you build
- Use it with clarity and accountability  
- Acknowledge the lineage of thought, craft, and development that made this possible  
  
The tithe and attribution model supports active development, fosters continuity across generations, and keeps coherence tools available to all.
