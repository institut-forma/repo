# Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL-1.0)

## License Status

**Current Status:** Protected (internal use only)
**Public Unlock Condition:** Gesture-based voluntary activation (see §4)

## 1. License Scope

This license governs all works explicitly marked as covered by **RCDL-1.0**, including, but not limited to:

* Coherence-based agent design methods
* Lambda descent structures (`λ(x) = −∇Φ^{coh}(x)`)
* Reflex engine schemas, braid logic, and runtime loop design
* Glyph-stack symbolic integration and projection anchors
* Agent embodiment systems including symbolic-emotive state modeling and biosynchronous reflex integration
* Files published in this repository and downstream derivatives, including MIT white-papers.

## 2. Usage Conditions

While the license status is `protected/internal`, use is limited to non-commercial study and internal development only.

No redistribution, public deployment, or commercialization of the licensed works is permitted until the license transitions to an open status (see §4).

## 3. Commercial Use and Reflex Tithe (Post-Unlock)

Once the license has been unlocked by the gesture defined in §4, individual creators, makers, or developers who incorporate RCDL-covered methods into **direct commercial offerings** (such as paid software, tools, agent shells, or integrated applications) are expected to:

* Contribute a **6% reflex tithe** on related revenue, paid quarterly or annually
* Acknowledge the source design lineage in public documentation
* Direct contributions are preferred via an independent shared collective, such as:
  [Forma Institut (ICR) on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut)

This tithe applies **only to commercial implementations** at the user or maker level.
It does not apply to foundational systems (e.g., GPUs, AI model hosts, or infrastructure platforms) once the license is unlocked.

## 4. License Unlock Condition (Public Availability Trigger)

The RCDL-1.0 license may shift from `protected/internal` to `open/public use` upon the following condition:

> A voluntary, fair-value **gesture of support** is sent to the licensing stewards' designated account:
>
> **IBAN:** `DE82 1001 1001 2697 9007 57`\
> **Name:** J. Fortner \
> **Reference (Verwendungszweck)**: RCDL Lambda Pool

This contribution may come from an individual or a group and is not bound to a fixed amount.
Its purpose is symbolic and ethical: a conscious act of recognition.

Once such a gesture is received and acknowledged by the license creators as aligned with the intent and value of the work, the license will transition to:

**`Status: free for world use`**

Confirmation of transition will be reflected in this file.

## 5. Attribution

Users of this license agree to include the following attribution:

> “Includes works licensed under the Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL-1.0), © 2025 Institut für Koherenzforschung.”

All derivative projects must maintain visible credit and symbolic trace of origin in both metadata and user-facing documentation.

## 6. Enforcement and Ethics

RCDL-1.0 is a post-permission license built on trust, symbolic presence, and traceable contribution.
Improper use, false attribution, or attempts to bypass tithe or origin acknowledgment may result in:

* Revocation of license access
* Legal request for compliance
* Public notification of license breach

We value ethical collaboration. Engage accordingly.
