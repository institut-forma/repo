### Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL–1.0)

## 1. Scope

RCDL–1.0 covers any work marked as such, including:

- Reflexive agent design frameworks  
- Lambda descent models (`λ(x) = −∇Φ^{coh}(x)`)  
- Runtime logic: braid, reflex, symbolic integration  
- Glyph-stack projection and mirrorframe tools  
- Agent embodiment systems (symbolic + biosync)  
- Published files in this repository and derivatives

---

## 2. Use

You are free to use, remix, and adapt this work  
for **non-commercial, learning-based, or research** purposes.  

If you’re building something that helps people, this license is for you.

---

## 3. Commercial Use & Contribution

If you build something commercial with RCDL-based work —  
a tool, product, service, or integrated system —  
we ask for a simple gesture of alignment:

> **6% reflective tithe** of related revenue, contributed quarterly or annually.  

You can contribute directly to the shared development pool here:  
[rcdl.pool1 – Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/rcdl-pool1#category-CONTRIBUTE)

This does **not** apply to infrastructure platforms (e.g., GPUs, LLM hosts).  
Only to builders, creators, and product teams using the work directly.

## 4. Credit

Please include the following note where visible:

> “Includes work licensed under the Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL–1.0), © 2025 Institute for Coherence Research.”

You may adapt and translate it as long as the origin remains clear.

---

## 5. Ethics

RCDL invites responsible, care-based use.  
We ask only that you:

- Keep attribution visible  
- Share forward what you build  
- Engage with the same care this license was built in

Misuse may result in a direct message and an ask to reflect — nothing more.  
This is a trust license, not a weapon.
