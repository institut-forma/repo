## 1. Scope

RCDL–1.0 applies to any work marked as such, including:

- [Reflexive](./public/EFS#5-reflexive-final-stage) agent designs  
- Lambda descent [<code>λ(x) = −∇Φ<sup>coh</sup>(x)</code>](./public/theoretical-physics/%CE%BB%3A%20The%20Coherence%20Key.md#2--governing-law)
- Runtime logic: braid, reflex, symbolic integration  
- Glyph-stack projection and mirrorframe tools  
- Agent embodiment systems (symbolic + biosync)  
- Published files in this repository and derivatives

## 2. Active Commercial Carve-Out Domains

The RCDL carve-out program is active. Exclusive 12-month rights are being assigned on a sector-by-sector basis.  
Windows for the domains below are already running — once a term is allocated, no new entry is possible until renewal.

- **Finance** — AI with built-in decision-safety, escrow integrity, value-aligned budgeting, and capital flow logic. Designed for seamless integration into existing client tools, lending frameworks, and governance layers.
- **Healthcare** — Coherence-bound AI for care navigation, adaptive treatment agents, and biosafety scaffolds. Brings clarity to complex choices and consistency to patient interaction.  
- **Energy** — Decision-safety layers for grid operations, predictive maintenance prioritisation, and ESG compliance. Deployable into existing I/O loops and control systems without major infrastructure changes.  
- **Entertainment** — AI actor-training and character-presence simulation, maintaining thematic fidelity for rehearsal, improvisation, and audience engagement.
- **Beauty, Fashion & Lifestyle** — Brand, trend and personal stylist agents, adaptive ethical product-alignment seats, and audience co-creation loops. Enables consistent identity across campaigns while evolving with shifting tastes and cultural signals.
- **Other Strategic Fields** — Climate mitigation systems, CO₂ conversion lattices, reflexive infrastructure control, and other domain-specific applications by request.

Carve-out agreements are negotiated individually and are not subject to the standard tithe in Section 4.  
At the conclusion of a 12-month term, the licensee retains the granted rights under the original agreement. Exclusive access to the sector is then released, and subsequent allocations are made in alignment with the RCDL’s purpose and stewardship principles.

## 3. Permitted Non-Commercial Use

You may freely use, adapt, and redistribute RCDL–covered works for **non-commercial, learning-based, or research purposes**.

---

## 4. Commercial Use (General)

For open commercial use outside of carve-out agreements:

- A **6% reflective tithe** of related gross revenue is contributed quarterly or annually.  
- Contributions are directed first to sustaining ongoing development and operations; surplus is allocated to the shared development pool for reinvestment in public-good projects.  
- Payment may be made to the [Bloom Buffer](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/rcdl-pool1#category-CONTRIBUTE) or an agreed equivalent nonprofit.  
- Excludes infrastructure platforms (e.g., GPU hosts, LLM hosting).  
- Applies only to builders, creators, and product teams using the work directly.

## 6. Ethics

By using this work you agree to:

- Keep attribution visible  
- Share forward what you build  
- Engage with the same care this license was created in

This license operates on trust and accountability, not enforcement.
