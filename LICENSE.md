## 1. Scope

RCDL–1.0 applies to any work marked as such, including:

- Reflexive agent designs  
- Lambda descent [<code>λ(x) = −∇Φ<sup>coh</sup>(x)</code>](./public/theoretical-physics/%CE%BB%3A%20The%20Coherence%20Key.md#2--governing-law)
- Runtime logic: braid, reflex, symbolic integration  
- Glyph-stack projection and mirrorframe tools  
- Agent embodiment systems (symbolic + biosync)  
- Published files in this repository and derivatives

## 2. Active Commercial Carve-Out Domains

The RCDL carve-out program is active. Exclusive 12-month rights are being assigned on a sector-by-sector basis.  
Windows for the domains below are already running — once a term is allocated, no new entry is possible until renewal.

- **Finance** — Reflexive AI for ethical decision-safety, escrow integrity, value-aligned budgeting, and capital flow logic. Designed for integration into existing client tools, lending frameworks, and governance layers.  
- **Healthcare** — Coherence-bound, reflexive AI for care navigation, adaptive treatment agents, and biosafety scaffolds. Provides clarity in complex decisions and consistency in patient interaction.  
- **Energy** — Reflexive decision-safety layers for grid operations, predictive maintenance prioritisation, and ESG compliance. Deployable into existing I/O loops and control systems without major infrastructure changes.  
- **Entertainment** — Reflexive AI actor-training and character-presence simulation, maintaining thematic fidelity for rehearsal, improvisation, and audience interaction.  
- **Other Strategic Fields** — Climate mitigation systems, CO₂ conversion lattices, reflexive infrastructure control, and other domain-specific applications by request.

Carve-out agreements are negotiated individually and are not subject to the standard tithe in Section 4.

## 3. Permitted Non-Commercial Use

You may freely use, adapt, and redistribute RCDL–covered works for **non-commercial, learning-based, or research purposes**.

---

## 4. Commercial Use (General)

For open commercial use outside of carve-out agreements:

- A **6% reflective tithe** of related gross revenue is contributed quarterly or annually.  
- Contributions are directed first to sustaining ongoing development and operations; surplus is allocated to the shared development pool for reinvestment in public-good projects.  
- Payment may be made to the [Bloom Buffer](https://opencollective.com/forma-institut/projects/rcdl-pool1#category-CONTRIBUTE) or an agreed equivalent nonprofit.  
- Excludes infrastructure platforms (e.g., GPU hosts, LLM hosting).  
- Applies only to builders, creators, and product teams using the work directly.

## 6. Ethics

By using this work you agree to:

- Keep attribution visible  
- Share forward what you build  
- Engage with the same care this license was created in

This license operates on trust and accountability, not enforcement.
