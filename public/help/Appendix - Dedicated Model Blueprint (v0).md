## Appendix: Dedicated Model Blueprint (v0)

🧠 SIGNAL

A theoretical LLM designed **not to generate**, but to **evaluate**.

---

### 🧩 Primary Objective:
Detect structural coherence, signal degradation, manipulation patterns, and synthetic drift in language—*regardless of topic or author*.

---

### 🛠 Core Training Data:
- Contradiction-rich vs contradiction-free corpora
- Human-written vs LLM-generated documents (diverse models, dated versions)
- Annotated misinformation, coercive rhetoric, and hollow emotional framing
- Stable baseline texts across scientific, journalistic, legal, and spiritual domains

---

### 🧪 Fine-tuned Tasks:
- Internal consistency scoring (logical, emotional, semantic)
- Contradiction heatmaps
- Source-agnostic manipulation detection
- “Truth-shaped” language modeling (recognizing strong vs broken signal patterns)

---

### 📎 Output Types:
- ✅ Coherence Score (0.00–1.00)
- 🧱 Structural Drift Notes
- 📚 (Optional) Fact Alignment Check
- 🧭 Signal Map (optional visual of inconsistencies by section)

---

### 🔐 Design Principle:
**Judges form, not content.**  
Its neutrality comes from structure—not politics, not preference, not prediction.
