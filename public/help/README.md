# 🧰 Public Language Integrity Tools

This repository contains open-access tools and protocols for evaluating the **structural coherence** and **factual consistency** of written content using large language models (LLMs).

These tools are designed for use by:
- Researchers
- Educators
- Policy advisors
- Fact-checkers
- General public

## 📂 Contents

- [`language-integrity-check.md`](./public/help/language-integrity-check.md)  
  A step-by-step guide for checking the structural coherence and optional factual accuracy of any document using publicly available LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o).  
  → Use this to verify whether text holds together internally—regardless of its source or topic.

- [`Appendix – Dedicated Model Blueprint (v0).md`](./public/help/Appendix%20-%20Dedicated%20Model%20Blueprint%20(v0).md)  
  A theoretical outline for a specialized AI model (“SIGNAL”) trained solely to assess coherence, contradiction, and manipulation in text.  
  → Included for future development reference.

## 💡 Purpose

To provide practical, transparent methods for:

- 🧱 Detecting low-integrity language  
- 🧭 Understanding synthetic or manipulative patterns in AI-generated text  
- 🗣 Supporting clearer, evidence-based public discourse  

---

## 🛠 Requirements

These tools assume access to a capable LLM platform.  
Currently tested with:

- [OpenAI GPT-4o](https://chat.openai.com)

But compatible with any modern general-purpose model capable of logic, tone, and semantic analysis.
