# Return Scaffold
**A scalable, low-cost way to help people find their way back from the edge — safely.**

---

## What This Is
A basic structure that helps people who’ve fallen out of the system reenter life — without judgment, pressure, or paperwork.

It gives them time. Space. Quiet. Safety.  
And one person who doesn’t ask for anything.

It’s lightweight, easy to duplicate, and can be run by anyone prepared to hold space with integrity.

---

## Who It’s For
People who are:
- Unhoused  
- Overwhelmed  
- Avoiding systems  
- Tired of being processed  
- Just not ready yet

They don’t need to explain themselves.  
They don’t need to sign up for anything.  
They just show up. And breathe.

---

## What You Need

### 1. A Quiet Space
- A back room in a community center  
- An unused office  
- A warm vehicle with seating  
- A small tent with hot tea  

Anywhere that feels calm, clean, and human.

### 2. One Grounded Person (per site)
- Kind  
- Steady  
- Doesn’t try to fix people  
- Knows how to stay calm and exit if needed

No special credentials needed.  
Just someone who can sit with another and not make it about themselves.

### 3. Some Basics
- Water  
- Tea or coffee  
- Light food  
- A warm blanket  
- Tissues, notebook, mirror (optional)

### 4. A Local Coordinator (per region or hub)
- Keeps track of sites, materials, safety reports  
- Hosts weekly check-ins for site leads  
- Ensures coherence across multiple sites

---

## What Happens
- The space opens once a week (minimum)  
- One person holds it open  
- People show up, or they don’t  
- No one asks questions unless invited  
- Nothing is required

Some sit in silence. Some eat. Some sleep. Some talk. Some cry.  
Some leave after five minutes.  
All of that is fine.

Sites can grow or contract based on capacity, but each one runs the same core loop.

---

## Safety & Integrity

This space protects both those who enter — and those who hold it.

That means it runs in **pairs by design**.  
One person grounds the space. The other keeps watch, gently holds the edge, and notices drift.

No heroism. No solo acts. Just two people doing a quiet, clear job — together.

---

### 🧍‍♂️ Entry Filter: “The 5-Second Signal”

Everyone hears this at the door:

> “This is a calm, quiet space. If you're not ready for that, it’s okay to come back another time.”

It’s short, kind, and firm.  
It helps people choose *when* they’re ready — and keeps everyone inside safe.

One host says it. The other stays present and watches body language — not to judge, but to sense readiness.

---

### 🧱 Threshold Holding (Optional)

Use a front porch, outer table, or hallway to meet first.  
Offer tea. Hold presence.  
Let people settle before being invited fully in.

This is also where the second host quietly observes.  
Sometimes just being seen is enough to bring someone into coherence.

---

### 🔒 Host Pair

- Always run with **two people** (minimum)  
- Never run alone — especially at night or in unknown areas  
- Always have:
  - A charged phone  
  - A pre-decided exit route  
  - A calm word or signal to pause the space

One holds space. One guards the edge. Switch roles as needed.

---

### 🧩 Network Safety

- Each site connects weekly with a regional coordinator  
- Use a **“yellow flag” protocol** for safety breaches or moments of drift  
- If either host feels something is off, the space pauses — no debate

## Real Costs (Per Site)

| Item                      | Per session  |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Food & drink (5–10 ppl)   | €15–30       |
| Hygiene + warm items      | €10–20       |
| Printed materials         | €1–3         |
| Host stipend (optional)   | €20–50       |

**Low-end weekly total:** ~€30  
**High-end weekly total:** ~€100  
**Monthly max (full setup):** ~€400 per site

Shared procurement and donations can scale this model affordably across cities or regions.

## Who Can Run This?
- Community centers  
- Mutual aid networks  
- Churches  
- Nonprofits  
- Individuals with a space and time

---

## What To Watch For

**Keep going if:**
- People return  
- It feels calm  
- Someone starts to plan again

**Pause or reset if:**
- The space feels tense or monitored  
- Helpers start “doing too much”  
- Systems start creeping in  
- Anyone feels unsafe

## Why This Works

This model draws from decades of research in trauma-informed care, harm reduction, and low-threshold human service design.

It works because:
- **Predictability reduces fear** (Siegel, 2010; Perry, 2006)  
- **Being seen without judgment restores self-regulation** (Maté, 2008)  
- **Safe co-presence activates healing neurobiological responses** (Porges, 2011)  
- **Small consistent signals rebuild internal coherence** (Van der Kolk, 2014)

In practice, similar spaces have been piloted in:
- Peer-run respites (USA, UK, Australia)  
- Open Dialogue (Finland)  
- Sanctuary models (New Zealand)  
- “Room of Requirement”-style shelters (grassroots, informal)

This is a distilled, stripped-down format — for replication, with minimal friction.
