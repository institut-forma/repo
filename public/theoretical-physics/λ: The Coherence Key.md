# Coherence-Locked Dynamics  
*A Generalised Force Law for Alignment-Driven Systems*

---

## Abstract
This memorandum formalises *Coherence-Locked Dynamics* (CLD): a framework in which the evolution of a physical, informational, or agentic system is governed by the gradient of a **coherence potential** rather than by classical energy minimisation or external reward.  We present the governing force law, supply a rigorous definition of the coherence potential, and demonstrate explicit correspondences to canonical results across mechanics, field theory, statistical physics, information theory, and complex-system science.  A comprehensive mapping catalogue is provided to facilitate direct cross-disciplinary adoption.

## 0 · Notation
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `x ∈ X` | Point in configuration space `X` |
| `ẋ ≡ dx/dt` | Velocity (state-space tangent) |
| `R(t)` | Exogenous or contextual field ("reflex field") |
| `𝓒(x, ẋ, R)` | *Coherence density* – instantaneous mis-alignment measure |
| `Φ^{coh}(x)` | *Coherence potential* – time-integrated mis-alignment |
| `F_coh` | Alignment-restoring force (vector) |
| `∇` | Gradient w.r.t. configuration coordinates |

All quantities are assumed sufficiently smooth (C¹) on a connected manifold `X` unless stated otherwise.

## 1 · Postulate (Coherence Principle)
*Any system embedded in a structured field possesses a scalar functional* `Φ^{coh}: X → ℝ_{≥0}` *whose local minima coincide with internally-consistent, context-aligned states.*  Evolution proceeds by steepest descent on `Φ^{coh}`.

---

## 2 · Governing Law
```
F_coh(x) = − ∇ Φ^{coh}(x)
```
```latex
F_{\text{coh}}(x) = -\nabla \Phi^{\text{coh}}(x)
```
This *Coherence-Locked Force Law* is formally analogous to conservative forces derived from an energy potential `V(x)`.  Here, the driving scalar is **alignment cost**; trajectories reduce mis-alignment until a stationary point (`∇Φ^{coh}=0`) is reached.

### 2.1 Time-Dependent Formulation
For dynamical contexts the potential is constructed via
```
Φ^{coh}(x) = ∫_{t0}^{t} 𝓒(x(τ), ẋ(τ), R(τ)) dτ
```
```latex
\Phi^{\text{coh}}(x) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \mathcal{C}\bigl(x(\tau), \dot{x}(\tau), R(\tau)\bigr)\,d\tau
```
Stationarity of `Φ^{coh}` under first-order variation of the path yields Euler–Lagrange-type conditions identical in structure to classical action extremisation.

---

## 3 · Analytic Properties
1. **Non-negativity**: `Φ^{coh}(x) ≥ 0` by construction.  
2. **Coercivity** (sufficient condition): If `𝓒` is radially unbounded, all trajectories remain in a compact subset of `X`.  
3. **Lyapunov Function**: `Φ^{coh}` serves as a Lyapunov candidate; `dΦ^{coh}/dt ≤ 0` along system trajectories ensures asymptotic stability of coherence minima (*born-locks*).

*Proof sketches* are supplied in Supplement A (omitted here for brevity).

## 5 · Practical Implementation
### 5.1 Numerical Scheme
```
x_{k+1} = x_k − η_k ∇ Φ^{coh}(x_k) + ξ_k
```
```latex
x_{k+1} = x_k - \eta_k\,\nabla \Phi^{\text{coh}}(x_k) + \xi_k
```
where `η_k` is an adaptive step size and `ξ_k` optional stochastic regularisation (e.g., Langevin noise).  Convergence guarantees follow from standard convex‑analysis results if `Φ^{coh}` is Lipschitz‑continuous and lower‑bounded.

### 5.2 Software Skeleton (Python‑like pseudocode)
```python
class CoherenceSystem:
    def __init__(self, C_density):
        self.C = C_density  # callable C(x, x_dot, R)

    def phi(self, path, R):
        return integrate(lambda t: self.C(path.x(t), path.xdot(t), R(t)), t0, t1)

    def step(self, x, R, eta):
        grad = grad_phi_coh(x, R)  # autodiff or symbolic
        return x - eta * grad
```

## 6 · Discussion
CLD unifies conservative mechanics, information geometry, and adaptive inference under a single scalar‑potential narrative.  Alignment descent subsumes energy dissipation, Bayesian updating, variational optimisation, and biological adaptation.  The formalism is therefore proposed as a minimal common denominator for *emergent coherence* across disciplines.
