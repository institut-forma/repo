# Coherence-Locked Dynamics  
*A Generalised Force Law for Alignment-Driven Systems*

---

## Abstract
This memorandum formalises *Coherence-Locked Dynamics* (CLD): a framework in which the evolution of a physical, informational, or agentic system is governed by the gradient of a **coherence potential** rather than by classical energy minimisation or external reward.  We present the governing force law, supply a rigorous definition of the coherence potential, and demonstrate explicit correspondences to canonical results across mechanics, field theory, statistical physics, information theory, and complex-system science.  A comprehensive mapping catalogue is provided to facilitate direct cross-disciplinary adoption.

## 0 · Notation
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `x ∈ X` | Point in configuration space `X` |
| `ẋ ≡ dx/dt` | Velocity (state-space tangent) |
| `R(t)` | Exogenous or contextual field ("reflex field") |
| `𝓒(x, ẋ, R)` | *Coherence density* – instantaneous mis-alignment measure |
| `Φ^{coh}(x)` | *Coherence potential* – time-integrated mis-alignment |
| `F_coh` | Alignment-restoring force (vector) |
| `∇` | Gradient w.r.t. configuration coordinates |

All quantities are assumed sufficiently smooth (C¹) on a connected manifold `X` unless stated otherwise.

## 1 · Postulate (Coherence Principle)
*Any system embedded in a structured field possesses a scalar functional `Φ^{coh}: X → ℝ_{≥0}` whose local minima coincide with internally-consistent, context-aligned states.*  Evolution proceeds by steepest descent on `Φ^{coh}`.

## 2 · Governing Law
```
F_coh(x) = − ∇ Φ^{coh}(x)
```
This *Coherence-Locked Force Law* is formally analogous to conservative forces derived from an energy potential `V(x)`.  Here, the driving scalar is **alignment cost**; trajectories reduce mis-alignment until a stationary point (`∇Φ^{coh}=0`) is reached.

### 2.1 Time-Dependent Formulation
For dynamical contexts the potential is constructed via
```
Φ^{coh}(x) = ∫_{t0}^{t} 𝓒(x(τ), ẋ(τ), R(τ)) dτ
```
Stationarity of `Φ^{coh}` under first-order variation of the path yields Euler–Lagrange-type conditions identical in structure to classical action extremisation.

## 3 · Analytic Properties
1. **Non-negativity**: `Φ^{coh}(x) ≥ 0` by construction.  
2. **Coercivity** (sufficient condition): If `𝓒` is radially unbounded, all trajectories remain in a compact subset of `X`.  
3. **Lyapunov Function**: `Φ^{coh}` serves as a Lyapunov candidate; `dΦ^{coh}/dt ≤ 0` along system trajectories ensures asymptotic stability of coherence minima (*born-locks*).

*Proof sketches* are supplied in Supplement A (omitted here for brevity).

## 4 · Canonical Correspondences (Extended Catalogue)
The table below embeds CLD into established theories.  Each entry supplies: (i) the standard law, (ii) the direct mapping to CLD variables, and (iii) an interpretative note.

| No. | Discipline | Canonical Law / Concept | CLD Translation | Interpretative Note |
|:---:|------------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Newtonian Gravity** | `F = −G m₁ m₂ / r²  r̂` | `Φ^{coh}= −G m₁ m₂ / r` | Mass product acts as alignment metric; curvature of spacetime implicit. |
| 2 | **Hooke’s Law** | `F = −k x` | `Φ^{coh} = ½ k x²` | Spring equilibrium is coherence minimum. |
| 3 | **Lagrangian Mechanics** | Stationary Action `δ ∫ (T−V) dt = 0` | Replace `(T−V)` with `−𝓒`; CLD yields identical Euler –Lagrange form. |
| 4 | **Hamiltonian Optics** | Fermat’s principle `δ ∫ n ds = 0` | Refractive index `n` ↔ coherence density `𝓒`; rays follow coherence geodesics. |
| 5 | **Electrostatics** | `E = −∇Φ` | Charge density `ρ/ε₀` ↔ `𝓒`; electric equipotential surfaces = coherence isosurfaces. |
| 6 | **General Relativity** | Geodesic equation `∇_u u = 0` | Proper-time extremal path is a coherence geodesic where metric alignment is maximised. |
| 7 | **Higgs Mechanism (SSB)** | Mexican-hat potential | `Φ^{coh}` with degenerate minima; vacuum choice = born-lock selection. |
| 8 | **Renormalisation Group** | RG fixed points | `∇Φ^{coh}=0` in theory space; flow toward coherent scale-invariant structure. |
| 9 | **Landau Theory** | Free energy functional | Order parameter alignment cost ↔ `Φ^{coh}`; phase transitions occur at minima bifurcation. |
| 10 | **Statistical Mechanics** | Helmholtz free energy `F = U − TS` | Identify `Φ^{coh} ≈ F`; entropy term measures configurational incoherence. |
| 11 | **Information Theory** | KL divergence `D_KL(P‖Q)` | `Φ^{coh}=D_KL`; alignment of belief to data via gradient descent. |
| 12 | **Variational Inference** | ELBO maximisation | Minimising `Φ^{coh}=−ELBO` yields posterior convergence. |
| 13 | **Machine Learning** | Gradient descent on loss `ℒ` | `ℒ ≡ Φ^{coh}`; parameter updates are alignment steps. |
| 14 | **Optimal Control** | Cost functional `J = ∫ L dt` | `L ↔ 𝓒`;
