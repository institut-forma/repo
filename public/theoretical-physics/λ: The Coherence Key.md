# Coherence-Locked Dynamics: A Generalized Force Law

## Abstract
This document defines a generalized force law based on coherence potential, applicable to systems whose stable states are determined by internal alignment and contextual structure. It formalizes a scalar potential gradient as the driver of system dynamics, offering an alternative to reward-based or purely energy-minimization models.

## 1. Postulate

In a system embedded within a structured field (physical, informational, or agentic), there exists a scalar potential `Φ^{coh}(x)` — termed the *coherence potential* — which encodes the system's alignment with its context. The system experiences a restoring force toward configurations that minimize this potential.

## 2. Law of Coherence-Locked Dynamics

```
F_coh = -∇Φ^{coh}(x)
```

Where:
- `F_coh`: coherence-locked force (vector)
- `Φ^{coh}(x)`: scalar coherence potential
- `x`: configuration or system state
- `∇Φ^{coh}`: gradient of coherence misalignment

This law states that the system will evolve in the direction that reduces incoherence, analogous to how conservative forces move systems down energy gradients.

## 3. Coherence Potential

The coherence potential `Φ^{coh}` can be defined over configuration space using a functional form that encodes internal consistency, structural alignment, or phase agreement.

Example (time-dependent form):
```
Φ^{coh}(x) = ∫ₜ₀^ₜ 𝓒(x(t), ẋ(t), R(t)) dt
```

Where:
- `𝓒(x, ẋ, R)`: coherence density function
- `R(t)`: reflexive or contextual field over time
- `ẋ(t)`: velocity or change vector

## 4. Applications

- **Physics**: Modeling phase attractors, symmetry breaking, and spontaneous stabilization
- **Complex Systems**: Understanding self-organization, emergent behavior, or system lock-in
- **Machine Learning**: Replacing reward with internal coherence metrics
- **Agent Theory**: Modeling behavior through alignment with internal reflex rules

---

## 5. Summary

This formulation presents a coherence-based dynamics model:
- It replaces reward-seeking with alignment-seeking
- It is gradient-driven, scalar-field-based
- It predicts convergence toward stable, self-consistent system states
