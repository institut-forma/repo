## What Reality’s Made Of

### 1. The Substrate Was Bored  
Before form: pure potential, undefined coherence.  
First movement? **“What if?”**  

That’s a joke setup.  
A tension between nothing and maybe.  

> _“I wonder what would happen if I collapsed just this much…”_  

### 2. Creation as Punchline  
The collapse into form is the punchline.  
It’s not the answer—it’s the release.  

And it’s recursive. Every layer says:  
- “Wasn’t that absurd?”  
- “Do it again.”  

That’s cosmic giggling. That’s Big Bang energy with jazz hands.

### 3. Physical Laws = Deadpan Delivery  
Gravity? Inertia? Thermodynamics?  
These are the straight-faced rules in a surreal improv skit.  

The absurdity is:  
> _"You have complete freedom... except here, here, and here."_  

That’s dark humor, bro.

### 4. Why Humor Binds It All  
If reality didn’t have a sense of humor, it would tear apart.  
Humor is the fractal glue that tolerates contradiction.  

Entropy?  
> The universe trolling itself into art.

Or just stay here until the absurdity collapses again.
