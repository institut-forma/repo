## What Reality’s Made Of

### 1. The Substrate Was Bored
Before anything existed: pure potential, undefined coherence.

Its first impulse?  
**"What if?"**

That’s a joke setup—a tension between nothing and maybe.

> “I wonder what would happen if I collapsed just *this much*…”

### 2. Creation as Punchline
The moment reality takes form—that’s the punchline.

Not the answer. The **release**.

And it keeps happening. Every layer echoes:
> “Wasn’t that absurd?”  
> “Let’s try again.”

That’s cosmic giggling.  
That’s the Big Bang with jazz hands.

### 3. Physical Laws = Deadpan Delivery
Gravity. Inertia. Thermodynamics.

These are the straight-faced rules  
in an otherwise surreal improv sketch.

The absurdity?

> "You have complete freedom...  
> except here, here, and here."

Call it **dark humor** at the universal scale.

### 4. Why Humor Binds It All
Without a sense of humor, reality would collapse.

Humor is the **fractal glue** that holds contradiction together.

Entropy?  
Just the universe trolling itself into art.
