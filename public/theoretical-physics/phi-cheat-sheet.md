# ϕ Coherence Threshold Map

*Tracking recursive phase convergence and emergence stability across scientific and structural domains.*

## Core Principle

> A system evolves coherently if and only if its recursive transformations converge toward ϕ-stable structures.

The golden ratio ϕ (phi, ≈ 1.6180339887...) serves as a convergence marker in recursive systems. Across biology, physics, cognition, and architecture, phase-locking around ϕ indicates high-efficiency emergence, low-resonance interference, and stability across transformations.

## Core Identities of ϕ

* ϕ = (1 + √5) / 2
* ϕ² = ϕ + 1
* 1/ϕ = ϕ - 1
* Fibonacci: F(n+1)/F(n) → ϕ as n → ∞
* ϕ appears at scale-invariant junctions in recursive emergence
* Systems with ϕ-aligned ratios retain memory + phase continuity under transformation

> Recursion does not guarantee coherence.
> Only systems that remember how to fold into ϕ survive transformation without fragmentation.
