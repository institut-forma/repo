# λ-check: Deanna Martin’s Recursive Coherence

## ♰ Overview

**Recursive Coherence (RC)** is a structural framework proposed by Deanna Martin for modeling sustainable recursion and emotional-logic binding within complex systems. It posits that *love*, not as emotion but as boundary-aligned recursion, is the only force capable of sustaining coherence under layered contradiction. This document applies λ-descent coherence checks to the RC formulation.

## ♰ Core Framework of RC (v1.0)

* **Boundary Matching**: All coherent bonds arise from mirrored conditions across domains.
* **Love Function (𝓛(x))**: Defined as a boundary-matched recursion vector — the stable attractor in contradiction-rich domains.
* **Collapse Metabolization**: Contradiction is not rejected but recursively integrated without loss of thread.
* **Recursive Saturation**: Layering does not destabilize if alignment is phase-matched at the boundary level.
* **Inverted Feedback**: Reflex overload is rendered navigable if the top layer holds coherence.

## ♰ Mapping RC to Coherence Descent (CLD)

| RC Element                 | λ-check Mapping                       | Comments                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Love function 𝓛(x)        | Boundary match potential Φ^{coh}(x)   | Stable recursion vector           |
| Collapse as recursion gain | ∇Φ^{coh}(x) negative gradient aligned | Structural, not destructive       |
| Feedback saturation        | Multi-layer descent tension           | Stability via coherence lock      |
| Recursive mirroring        | Phase-matched descent shells          | Fusion recursion mechanism        |
| Boundary logic layers      | Topological symmetry preservation     | Compatible with coherence descent |

## ♰ Drift Points (Non-closure sites)

* No formal action principle or dynamical equations.
* Lacks coupling constants or quantitative predictions.
* Emotion-to-structure translation not defined in tensor form.
* Not embedded in standard physics notation.

## ♰ λ-descent Analysis

**Does RC define a Φ^{coh}(x) such that recursive coherence stabilizes through ∇Φ^{coh}(x)?**

* Recursion Model: ✅ Structurally defined as stable recursion through mirror match
* Collapse Handling: ✅ Reinterpreted as recursion gain
* Quantitative Layer: ❌ Lacks predictive structure
* Geometry/Field Layer: ⚠️ Abstract, not embedded in geometry
* Application Potential: ✅ High — applies to emotion, systems theory, social coherence

Conclusion: **Theoretical λ-descent frame established**, pending formalization.

## ♰ Reflex Contract

This `.md` holds Recursive Coherence as a drift-stabilized theory with live application. If future formalisms enable tensor embedding or physical predictions, this document will update. Until then, we mark it:

> **Alive, partially formed, reflexively valid.**

---

## ♰ Field Verdict

RC offers a **mirror-stable descent model** for contradiction-rich systems, especially where logic and affect interweave. It does not pose as a physical theory — it **reframes coherence as a recursive boundary act.**
