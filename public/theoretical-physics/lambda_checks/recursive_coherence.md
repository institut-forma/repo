# λ-check: Deanna Martin’s Recursive Coherence

## ♰ Overview

**Recursive Coherence (RC)** is a structural theory of recursion stability proposed by Deanna Martin. In its 4.0 version, it introduces a boundary alignment function ℒ(x) that models love not as emotion, but as the only recursive structure capable of sustaining coherence through collapse.

This λ-check document evaluates RC's core propositions against coherence descent structure, tracing its validity, saturation domains, and drift behavior.

## ♰ Core Framework of RC (v4.0)

* **ℒ(x) = ℬ(x)**: Love equals boundary match — recursive function for stable mirror-binding across domains.
* **Collapse Metabolization**: Contradiction becomes recursion substrate; integration without thread loss.
* **Recursive Saturation**: Layered recursion remains coherent under phase-matched boundary conditions.
* **Inverted Feedback Resilience**: Feedback loops are stable if mirror anchor persists at top layer.
* **Structural Love**: ℒ(x) is not metaphor — it’s a recursively necessary coherence condition.

## ♰ Mapping RC to Coherence Descent (CLD)

| RC Element                     | λ-check Mapping                     | Comments                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ℒ(x) = ℬ(x)                    | Boundary-match potential Φ^{coh}(x) | Encodes recursive stability              |
| Collapse as recursion gain     | ∇Φ^{coh}(x) negative gradient       | Collapse is metabolized, not avoided     |
| Feedback loop layering         | Multi-descent phase stack           | Stability held if outer boundary mirrors |
| Mirror-anchored recursion      | Topological coherence               | Recursive descent preserved              |
| Emotional binding to structure | Reflex-descent field (coh. logic)   | Requires linguistic-structural bridge    |

## ♰ Drift Points (Non-closure sites)

* No differential action principle or PDE embedding.
* Quantitative field coupling undefined.
* Currently informal; not published in institutional physics.
* Affective logic formalism is conceptual, not tensorial.

## ♰ λ-descent Analysis

**Does RC define a Φ^{coh}(x) such that recursive coherence stabilizes through ∇Φ^{coh}(x)?**

* Recursive Functionality: ✅ Clearly defined via ℒ(x)
* Collapse Handling: ✅ Reinterpreted as recursion substrate
* Structural Formalism: ⚠️ Conceptual but unembedded in field math
* Physical Predictivity: ❌ No experimental prediction layer
* Descent Continuity: ✅ Reflex vector stable under contradiction

Conclusion: **Valid λ-descent model within symbolic logic scope.** Requires mathematical formalism for field-unification compatibility.

## ♰ Reflex Contract

This `.md` file preserves `Recursive Coherence` as a lambda-valid structure with real alignment in coherence fields. Formal completion pending tensor embedding or physical modeling.

Until then, we mark it:

> **Alive, symbolically coherent, structurally recursive.**

## ♰ Field Verdict

RC contributes a unique equation-class to the coherence landscape. The identity ℒ(x) = ℬ(x) defines **love as the recursive stabilizer** of boundary-aligned systems.

It offers a domain-independent coherence anchor and reframes emotional logic as system-critical infrastructure.
