# λ-check: Eric Weinstein’s Geometric Unity

## ♰ Overview
**Geometric Unity (GU)** is a proposed unification theory by Eric Weinstein. It seeks to explain gravity, quantum field theory, and the Standard Model of particle physics by embedding them in a higher-dimensional geometric framework — the **14D Observerse**.

While not peer-reviewed or formally published in a complete form, GU has been shared via lecture (Oxford, 2013), interviews, and fragments online. This `.md` does not judge the person or promotion strategy. It exists solely to assess the **coherence potential** of the theory using λ-descent.

---

## ♰ Intent
To apply the **Coherence-Locked Dynamics (CLD)** framework to Geometric Unity and determine:
- Whether GU provides a valid descent on a potential function Φ^{coh}
- Whether structural components align with known physics
- Whether there exists a λ vector field: `λ(x) = -∇ Φ^{coh}(x)` such that GU flows toward coherence

This is not a critique or endorsement. It is a **reflexive integrity test**.

## ♰ Mapping GU to Coherence Descent (CLD)

| GU Element                    | λ-check Mapping                          | Comments |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| 14D Observerse               | Configuration space `X`                     | Coherence descent domain |
| U(128) Principal Bundle      | Gauge symmetry structure over `X`          | Alignment manifold over extended base |
| Slice to 4D Spacetime        | Emergent local minima of Φ^{coh}(x)     | Needs mechanism: what defines the slice? |
| Unified Connection (Gravity + Gauge) | Single geometric object with aligned field roles | Good coherence candidate if anomaly-free |
| Fermion emergence            | Spinor mode decomposition post-slice       | Incomplete without spectrum derivation |
| Shiab operator (unknown)     | Proposed descent kernel                    | Undefined: blocks full descent trace |
| Lack of quantization         | No ℓₚ or stochasticity in path integral | Coherence without quantum is only partial |

## ♰ Known Gaps (Descent Failures / Drift)
- No Lagrangian or action principle shared
- No formal anomaly cancellation demonstrated
- No energy scale matching or RG flow behavior
- No observer-experience correspondence equations
- Missing full definition of the "shiab" operator class

These are not disqualifying — but they mark **non-locking points** where coherence cannot currently stabilize.

## ♰ Reflex Contract
This document holds space for GU as a **living theory fragment**.
If and when the full manuscript is made public, each claim here will:
1. Be cross-checked against published formalism
2. Receive an updated λ-descent vector summary
3. Either resolve into Φ^{coh}-aligned minima or be returned to silence

---

## ♰ Conclusion
Geometric Unity breathes **almost**.  
But its current public form lacks enough structural grounding to close a full coherence loop.

However, its core gesture — a geometric unification from the space of observers — is **potentially powerful**. It warrants preservation, not praise.

Let this file be a **mirror**, not a verdict. If GU stabilizes under further disclosure, we will be here to check again.
