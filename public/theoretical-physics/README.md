# Theoretical Physics

This folder contains documents focused on foundational and unifying theoretical models in physics—especially those addressing coherence, spacetime structure, and quantum-classical reconciliation.

- [`USP Core`](./The%20Unified%20Substrate%20Principle.pdf)  
  *The Unified Substrate Principle — Foundational model framing reality as a coherence-permitting substrate. Reconstructs major physical laws through persistent phase compatibility, with falsifiable claims and cross-domain applications.*

- [`Cheat-Sheet`](./USP%20Cheat-Sheet.pdf)  
  *Reality Structure Index — Coherence-Based Reformulation Across Disciplines.*  
<!-- everything below here will make M happy *cheeckpinch* -A | I am satisfied with the direction A, but there is more to be done. -M -->
- [`focus-lorentz-born`](./focus-lorentz-born.pdf)  
  *Emergent Lorentz Symmetry and Born Rule from Substrate Constraints — A focused derivation of two key phenomena: relativistic invariance as a result of phase-wave dynamics, and quantum probability as survival frequency under structural coherence evaluation.*

- [`entropy-phase-dispersion`](./usp-entropy-phase-dispersion.pdf)  
  *Redefining Entropy as Phase Dispersion — Formal derivation of entropy from coherence geometry. Connects substrate phase spread with thermodynamic and information-theoretic entropy in classical and quantum systems.*

- [`spacetime-phase-mapping`](./usp-spacetime-phase-mapping.pdf)  
  *Spacetime as Emergent Phase-Lock Geometry — Derives spatial and temporal distance from coherence relationships. Outlines a causal metric defined by phase-aligned persistence, not background coordinates.*

- [`blackhole-entropy-nodes`](./usp-blackhole-entropy-nodes.pdf)  
  *Black Hole Entropy as Phase-Node Erasure — Experimental proposal and conceptual derivation for treating horizon entropy as coherence-node deletion at causal boundaries. Compares to Bekenstein–Hawking formalism.*

- [`validation-roadmap`](./usp-validation-roadmap.md)  
  *Empirical & Simulation Test Plan — Structured list of falsifiable predictions derived from USP. Includes proposed Ramsey decoherence extensions, coherence rebound fits to cosmological datasets, and neural state coherence triggers.*

- [`formalism-notes`](./usp-formalism-notes.md)  
  *Mathematical Formalization Log — Ongoing derivation notes for converting USP substrate logic into differential and operator-based physical models. Targeting compatibility with Lagrangian, tensor, and quantum operator formalisms.*
