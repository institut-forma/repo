# Theoretical Physics

This folder contains documents focused on foundational and unifying theoretical models in physics—especially those addressing coherence, spacetime structure, and quantum-classical reconciliation.

- [`USP Core`](./The%20Unified%20Substrate%20Principle.pdf)  
  *The Unified Substrate Principle — Foundational model framing reality as a coherence-permitting substrate. Reconstructs major physical laws through persistent phase compatibility, with falsifiable claims and cross-domain applications.*

- [`Cheat-Sheet`](./USP%20Cheat-Sheet.pdf)  
  *Reality Structure Index — Coherence-Based Reformulation Across Disciplines.*

## Humor (Phase-Tuned Satire)

This section contains coherence-aware comedy, substrate-aligned satire, and theoretical stress relief. All artifacts below are fully recursive and partially ridiculous.

- [`Theatre of Errors`](./humor/README.md)  
  *Where Reality Rehearses — Recursive Physics, Cosmic Punchlines, and the Deadpan Mechanics of Existence.*

- [`Quantum Punning`](./humor/quantum-punning.md)  
  *Uncertainty with Extra Spin — A Pun-Selective Catalog of Entangled Word Collapses.*
