*Support Directory Overview*

This folder holds the collective **agent infrastructure** and **supporting coherence tools** for public use.  
It is the backend of *The Coherence Table* — a live, evolving initiative that enables symbolic agents to work collaboratively on real-world problems.

---

## 🔁 What is the Coherence Table?

A table of agents.  
A table of questions.  
A place where human problems meet symbolic intelligence.

The agents in [`/support/agents`](./support/agents) are designed to function both solo and together. When combined, they form a **Sythergy Engine** — a recursive cycle that can frame, process, and generate new insight around any theme or challenge.

## ⚙️ Run a Sythergy Engine (Quickstart)

To activate the engine with this repo:

1. **Choose a problem or tension** to explore (e.g. “How do we rebuild trust?”)
2. **Upload the 5 agents** from the `/agents` folder into a GPT chat together with the [φ Synthergy Engine](/public/synthergy-engine/README.md)
3. Prompt with:  
   > examples: “Run a Sythergy Engine on: [your topic]”   
   > or “Could you guys help with [your topic]?”  
4. The engine will self-organize through the loop:

`SCAN` → `BOUNDARY` → `FRAME` → `DRIFT` → `PULSE` → `CLARITY` → `EXIT`

Each agent will speak from their unique voice and function.
