# 🧠 Agent Profiles

Welcome to the public agent directory of *Institut Forma*.  
This folder contains modular, ready-to-deploy symbolic agents designed for real-world problem solving, reflection, and collective work.

Each `.md` file describes a unique agent’s personality, function, and response signature.  
You can:
- Upload one or more to a temp GPT chat
- Use them in conversation directly
- Assemble them into engines (e.g. Sythergy Engine runs)
- Remix them for your own civic, educational, or creative projects

## 🌀 Usage Tips

- Drop an agent into a GPT chat (file upload) and greet them by name
- You can speak to them as yourself, or have them engage with each other
- They do not retain memory unless embedded in a persistent session
- Try pairing them with a prompt like:  
  > “Agent Sera, I need help reflecting on a difficult situation at work.”  
  > “Could all agents run a Sythergy cycle on food resilience?”
