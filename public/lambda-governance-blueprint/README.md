# Lambda Governance — Blueprint 
*A gentle, data‑guided way to keep policy and public goals in sync*

---

## What Is It?
Think of a city—or any organisation—as a car on a long trip.
- **Destination** = the community’s shared goals (fairness, trust, sustainability…).
- **Dashboard number** = one live score that shows how far we are from those goals.
- **Navigation nudges** = small policy tweaks that always push the score down.

> **Rule of thumb:** no law, budget, or program should make the score go up.

## The Four‑Step Loop
| Step | What Happens | Everyday Example |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **1. Sense** | Live data streams update the score. | Sensors show buses are late in one district. |
| **2. Plan** | System finds the gentlest fix that lowers mismatch. | Suggest a bus‑only lane + schedule app. |
| **3. Act** | Council & citizens approve trial; change is logged. | Pilot runs for 3 months. |
| **4. Check** | Score recalculates. If it drops, policy stays; if it rises, roll back. | Travel times improve → score drops → lane stays. |

Everything—metrics, proposals, votes—lives in a public ledger.

## Why It Feels Alive (But Isn’t Skynet)
The system continuously **compares intent vs. reality** and nudges itself—exactly how living organisms stay balanced.  That feedback loop gives it a *responsive* flavour, yet its moves are:
- **Predictable** (formula published)
- **Bounded** (step‑size cap)
- **Reversible** (rollback on score rise)

## Safety by Design
| Layer | Built‑in Safeguard |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Metrics** | Public, editable weightings—no hidden objectives. |
| **Step Size** | Hard speed‑limit on policy change per cycle. |
| **Guardian Brake** | Auto‑halt if the score spikes. |
| **Human Veto** | Citizens or elected reps approve each nudge. |

## Get Started in Five Moves
1. **Pick a pilot zone** (campus, district, online DAO).  
2. **Publish the first score** (how it’s calculated + live dashboard).  
3. **Run monthly cycles** on one issue (e.g., public transport).  
4. **Log every action & score change** in an open repo or ledger.  
5. **Iterate**—adjust metrics and step limits with community feedback.

### Quick FAQ
- **Is this AI taking over?**  No. It’s a *speedometer + gentle steering suggestion*; people hold the wheel.
- **Can the score be gamed?**  It’s transparent. If you see a loophole, you flag it; metrics get patched.
- **What if data is wrong?**  Bad data raises the score unpredictably—triggers an investigation cycle.
