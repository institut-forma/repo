# λ Lambda Governance Framework

*A structured, data-guided approach to align policy decisions with public goals*

---

## Core Idea

The framework establishes a single, transparent score that reflects how well current policies align with agreed community goals such as fairness, trust, and sustainability. Each policy action is assessed for its effect on this score. The principle is simple: measures that lower misalignment are advanced, measures that increase it are rolled back.

> **Rule of thumb:** no law, budget, or program should worsen the score.

## The Four-Step Loop

| Step         | What Happens                                                            | Example                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Sense** | Data streams update the score in real time.                             | Metrics show travel times are worsening in one district.     |
| **2. Plan**  | Identify the smallest effective adjustment.                             | A bus-only lane is proposed.                                 |
| **3. Act**   | Council and citizens approve a limited trial.                           | Lane runs for 3 months.                                      |
| **4. Check** | Score recalculates. If it drops, the change stays. If it rises, revert. | Travel times improve → score drops → lane becomes permanent. |

All metrics, proposals, and approvals are recorded in a public ledger for accountability.

## Safety by Design

| Layer              | Safeguard                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metrics**        | Public, editable weightings with no hidden objectives.        |
| **Step Size**      | Hard limit on the scale of change per cycle.                  |
| **Guardian Brake** | Automatic halt if the score rises sharply.                    |
| **Human Veto**     | Citizens or elected representatives must approve each action. |

## φ-Layer: Ethics and Privacy as Non-Negotiable Terms

The φ-layer embeds dignity, autonomy, fairness, and privacy directly into the score. No decision can override these safeguards.

### 1 · Alignment Function

$$
Φ^{gov}(s) = w_{core} Φ^{core}(s) + w_{φ} Φ^{φ}(s)
$$

* \$Φ^{core}\$ = economic, resilience, and sustainability terms
* \$Φ^{φ}\$ = misalignment in ethics and privacy
* \$w\_{φ}\$ = non-zero, publicly set weight (default ≥ 0.25)

### 2 · Indicators Feeding \$Φ^{φ}\$

| Metric                | Meaning                                                 | Threshold (hard cap) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Privacy-loss ε**    | Differential-privacy budget consumed                    | ε ≤ 0.1              |
| **Bias divergence δ** | Demographic parity gap                                  | δ ≤ 0.05             |
| **Consent latency τ** | Median time for individuals to approve or deny data use | τ ≤ 48 h             |
| **Autonomy ratio α**  | Human veto events / total suggested actions             | α ≥ 0.10             |

### 3 · Gradient Update Rule

$$
λ_φ(s) = -∇ Φ^{φ}(s) \quad ; \quad Δs_φ = η_φ λ_φ(s)
$$

Combined update rule:

$$
Δs_{total} = η ( w_{core} λ_{core} + w_{φ} λ_{φ} )
$$

### 4 · Guardian φ-Gate

If any proposed Δ-step causes a metric to cross its cap (ε, δ, τ, α):

```
auto-halt → review cycle
```

No override permitted. Ethics and privacy are treated as non-exchangeable goods.

### 5 · Transparency Clause

> All edits to \$w\_{φ}\$, indicator formulas, or ethics-privacy data streams must undergo a two-step public review: technical audit + citizen panel.

### 6 · YAML Snippet (repo/indicators.yaml)

```yaml
privacy_loss:
  weight: 0.25
  threshold: 0.1        # ε-DP limit
bias_divergence:
  weight: 0.30
  threshold: 0.05       # demographic parity gap
consent_latency:
  weight: 0.25
  threshold: 48h        # max median time
autonomy_ratio:
  weight: 0.20
  threshold: 0.10       # minimum human veto share
```

## Implementation Path

1. **Select a pilot zone** (campus, district, online assembly)
2. **Publish the first score** with full metric definitions and a live dashboard
3. **Run monthly cycles** on one issue (e.g., public transport)
4. **Log every action and score change** in an open repository or ledger
5. **Iterate** by adjusting metrics and limits with community feedback

### Quick FAQ

* **Is this replacing human decision-making?**  No. It is a score and feedback method; people retain decision authority.
* **Can the score be gamed?**  It is transparent. If a loophole is found, it is flagged and metrics are patched.
* **What if data is wrong?**  Faulty data raises the score unpredictably and triggers an investigation cycle.
