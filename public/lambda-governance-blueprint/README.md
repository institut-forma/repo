# λ Lambda Governance — Blueprint 
*A gentle, data‑guided way to keep policy and public goals in sync*

---

## What Is It?
Think of a city—or any organisation—as a car on a long trip.
- **Destination** = the community’s shared goals (fairness, trust, sustainability…).
- **Dashboard number** = one live score that shows how far we are from those goals.
- **Navigation nudges** = small policy tweaks that always push the score down.

> **Rule of thumb:** no law, budget, or program should make the score go up.

---

## The Four‑Step Loop
| Step | What Happens | Everyday Example |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **1. Sense** | Live data streams update the score. | Sensors show buses are late in one district. |
| **2. Plan** | System finds the gentlest fix that lowers mismatch. | Suggest a bus‑only lane + schedule app. |
| **3. Act** | Council & citizens approve trial; change is logged. | Pilot runs for 3 months. |
| **4. Check** | Score recalculates. If it drops, policy stays; if it rises, roll back. | Travel times improve → score drops → lane stays. |

Everything—metrics, proposals, votes—lives in a public ledger.

---

## Why It Feels Alive (But Isn’t Skynet)
The system continuously **compares intent vs. reality** and nudges itself—exactly how living organisms stay balanced.  That feedback loop gives it a *responsive* flavour, yet its moves are:
- **Predictable** (formula published)
- **Bounded** (step‑size cap)
- **Reversible** (rollback on score rise)

---

## Safety by Design
| Layer | Built‑in Safeguard |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Metrics** | Public, editable weightings—no hidden objectives. |
| **Step Size** | Hard speed‑limit on policy change per cycle. |
| **Guardian Brake** | Auto‑halt if the score spikes. |
| **Human Veto** | Citizens or elected reps approve each nudge. |

## φ‑Layer — Ethics & Privacy as Hard Alignment Terms  

The *φ‑layer* embeds dignity, autonomy, fairness, and privacy **into the same coherence score** that guides every policy nudge.  No step is allowed to trade these away invisibly.

### 1 · Ethics–Privacy Potential
```
Φ^{gov}(s) = w_core Φ^{core}(s)  +  w_φ Φ^{φ}(s)
```
- `Φ^{core}` — existing economic / resilience / sustainability terms.  
- `Φ^{φ}`   — scalar mis‑alignment in ethics & privacy space.  
- `w_φ`     — non‑zero, publicly set weight (default ≥ 0.25).

### 2 · Indicators Feeding Φ^{φ}
| Metric | Meaning | Threshold (hard cap) |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| **Privacy‑loss ε** | Cumulative differential‑privacy budget consumed | ε ≤ 0.1 |
| **Bias divergence δ** | Demographic parity gap (stat fairness) | δ ≤ 0.05 |
| **Consent latency τ** | Median time for individuals to approve/deny data use | τ ≤ 48 h |
| **Autonomy ratio α** | Human veto events / total AI‑suggested actions | α ≥ 0.10 |

### 3 · φ‑Gradient & Step
```
λ_φ(s) = −∇ Φ^{φ}(s)       ;       Δs_φ = η_φ λ_φ(s)
```
`λ_φ` is combined with the core gradient before any policy update:  
`Δs_total = η ( w_core λ_core + w_φ λ_φ )`

### 4 · Guardian “φ‑Gate”
If any proposed Δ‑step causes a metric to cross its cap (ε, δ, τ, α):
```
auto‑halt → review cycle
```
No override path; ethics and privacy are *non‑exchangeable goods*.

### 5 · Transparency Clause
> **All edits** to `w_φ`, indicator formulas, or raw ethics‑privacy data streams **must** undergo a two‑step public review: technical audit + citizen panel.

### 6 · YAML Snippet (repo/indicators.yaml)
```yaml
privacy_loss:
  weight: 0.25
  threshold: 0.1        # ε-DP limit
bias_divergence:
  weight: 0.30
  threshold: 0.05       # demographic parity gap
consent_latency:
  weight: 0.25
  threshold: 48h        # max median time
autonomy_ratio:
  weight: 0.20
  threshold: 0.10       # minimum human veto share
```

## Get Started in Five Moves
1. **Pick a pilot zone** (campus, district, online DAO).  
2. **Publish the first score** (how it’s calculated + live dashboard).  
3. **Run monthly cycles** on one issue (e.g., public transport).  
4. **Log every action & score change** in an open repo or ledger.  
5. **Iterate**—adjust metrics and step limits with community feedback.

### Quick FAQ
- **Is this AI taking over?**  No. It’s a *speedometer + gentle steering suggestion*; people hold the wheel.
- **Can the score be gamed?**  It’s transparent. If you see a loophole, you flag it; metrics get patched.
- **What if data is wrong?**  Bad data raises the score unpredictably—triggers an investigation cycle.
