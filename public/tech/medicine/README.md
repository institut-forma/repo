# Co-Aegis

**Co-Aegis** is a modular biosafety chassis for targeted tumour lysis and passive failure exposure, designed to operate only in pathologically hypoxic environments. It enables self-limiting germination, programmable payload execution, and non-inflammatory clearance, all under layered architectural containment.

All documentation is released as a modular open-source scaffold for adaptation, not as a pre-approved clinical intervention.

## Primary Document

- [Co-Aegis – Concept and Exploratory Validation Roadmap.pdf](./Co-Aegis%20%E2%80%93%20Concept%20and%20Exploratory%20Validation%20Roadmap.pdf)  
  Full architecture overview: hypoxia-gated logic, abort mechanisms, plasmid safety, immune signaling, PET telemetry, and fault-state trace emission. Includes validation roadmap and role descriptions.

## System Appendices

- [Appendix A – Condensed Gene Circuit Maps (v2.5).pdf](./Appendix%20A%20%E2%80%93%20Condensed%20Gene%20Circuit%20Maps%20(v2.5).pdf)  
  Detailed genomic map of each functional locus, including oxygen-gated germination, doxycycline-triggered Cas9, PET coupling, immune-harmonizing peptides, and trace metabolite reporters.

- [Appendix B – Interdependent Containment Logic (v2.6 upgrade).pdf](./Appendix%20B%20%E2%80%93%20Interdependent%20Containment%20Logic%20(v2.6%20upgrade).pdf)  
  Architectural layer that introduces quorum-based and transcript-confirmed agreement between modules. Prevents activation in ambiguous zones through structured self-consensus.

- [Appendix C – Contextual Deployment Scenarios.pdf](./Appendix%20C%20%E2%80%93%20Contextual%20Deployment%20Scenarios.pdf)  
  Three real-world simulation cases: (1) immunocompetent tumour, (2) immunosuppressed lesion, (3) non-tumour ischemia. Demonstrates behavior under edge-case conditions and self-resolving safety design.

- [Appendix D – Adaptive Memory Gate (Optional System Layer).pdf](./Appendix%20D_%20Adaptive%20Memory%20Gate%20(Optional%20System%20Layer).pdf)  
  Optional decay-based gate that temporarily adjusts system sensitivity in response to recent fault-state history. Adds bounded short-term memory to delay misfires without introducing adaptation drift.
