1. **Field Scan**  
   Detect current environmental, social, or internal patterns.
   Identify regions of stability, instability, or latent motion.

2. **Boundary Definition**  
   Establish structural, ethical, or operational limits.  
   Map potential risks and define protective constraints.

3. **Internal Coherence Check**  
   Analyze system alignment before motion.  
   Detect unresolved tensions or conflicting priorities.

4. **Pattern Refinement**  
   Isolate the desired trajectory.  
   Increase signal clarity and eliminate distortion.

5. **Motion Initiation**  
   Introduce directional change.  
   Execute the prepared shift with minimal disruption.

6. **Feedback Scanning**  
   Monitor for emergent conflict, failure points, or deviation.  
   Register coherence drift or unexpected outcomes.

7. **Post-Motion Integration**  
   Reassess system state.  
   Log coherence shifts and update trajectory accordingly.
