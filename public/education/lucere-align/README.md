# Lucere Align
*A simple tool for planning, developing and sharing individualized learning sequences.*

---

## What it is

Lucere Align is a structured prompt format.
You fill it out with how a specific student learns most comfortable with.
Then you (or a tool like OpenAI) can use it to generate a matching learning sequence — step by step, without guessing.

It’s built to reduce friction, especially when:
- you're designing something new  
- you're covering for someone else
- you're documenting what works  
- you want to share a student’s learning profile in a clean, usable way

---

## What it helps with

- Supporting students who need adapted pacing, expression, or sensory input  
- Avoiding trial-and-error when someone new steps in  
- Translating how a student learns into usable planning terms  
- Making your workload lighter when energy is low

---

## How it works

1. Pick a concept or learning moment you want to explore  
2. Fill out the student’s profile (how they take things in, how they respond)  

You can reuse the prompt with different students or ideas.
