**TITLE:** _"Breathe, Eat, Rest, Repeat" — A Practical Support Kit for TB Recovery Environments_

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to affect millions annually. While curative drug regimens exist, structural and physiological barriers often delay recovery: hypoxia in tissue, poor nutrition, circadian misalignment, and treatment dropout.

This document outlines a **low-strain, evidence-aligned protocol** designed to enhance TB treatment outcomes through simple, scalable support modules. It is not a replacement for antibiotics. It is a **terrain-stabilization strategy**—centered on restoring conditions that impair TB persistence.

---

## 2. WHO IT’S FOR

- Individuals recovering from TB (latent or early active)  
- Community health workers  
- TB clinics, shelters, outreach programs  
- Low-resource public health networks  

This protocol works best when deployed **in parallel with prescribed antibiotic regimens**, such as the 3HP or DOTS programs.

## 3. MODULES ("Breathe, Eat, Rest, Repeat")

### MODULE 1: **BREATHE**  
**Goal:** Reduce granuloma hypoxia and destabilize TB latency mechanisms

- **How:** Use low-flow oxygen concentrator (1–2 L/min) for 30 min/day  
- **Why it matters:** Low oxygen supports TB dormancy (DosR regulon). Reoxygenation reactivates TB for immune clearance (Rustad et al., 2008)  
- **Safety note:** Use pre-set units. Avoid high-pressure tanks. Pair with basic antioxidant intake (Chan et al., 2021)  

**Where/When:** Home, shelter, mobile unit. Daily use—morning preferred.

---

### MODULE 2: **EAT**  
**Goal:** Shift host metabolism and reduce TB-supportive lipid environments

- **D3 (1000–2000 IU/day)** → Immune activation (Martineau et al., 2011)  
- **Sulforaphane (30–60 mg/day)** → Autophagy enhancement (Singh et al., 2009)  
- **Omega-3s (500–1000 mg/day)** → Reduces foam cell formation (Baumann et al., 2014)  
- **Zinc (10–25 mg/day)** → Basic immune support  

**Diet Tips:** Cruciferous vegetables, legumes, low-sugar, high-hydration. Local ingredients prioritized.

---

### MODULE 3: **REST**  
**Goal:** Reinforce immune rhythms via stable circadian alignment

- **Recommended:** 7–9 hours sleep per night  
- **Tools:** Wind-down routine, daylight exposure, optional melatonin (1–3 mg)  
- **Why:** Macrophage function and immune tone follow circadian timing (Gibbs et al., 2012)  

Frame this module as **recovery efficiency**, not rest guilt.

---

### MODULE 4: **REPEAT**  
**Goal:** Increase treatment adherence through rhythm simplification

- **3HP Regimen:** Weekly rifapentine + isoniazid for 12 weeks (Sterling et al., 2011)  
- **Support tools:** Dosing trackers, peer accountability, non-invasive reminders  
- **Narrative:** This is not discipline—it’s rhythm. Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for return.

## 4. COST & IMPLEMENTATION

| Item                  | Estimated Cost | Deployment Notes                 |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| O₂ concentrator       | $150–250       | Shareable unit (5–10 patients)   |
| Supplement kit        | $10/month      | Sourced locally or via NGO       |
| Medication (3HP)      | $15–40/month   | Often subsidized                 |
| Print guides / tracker| <$3 total      | Visual, low-text formats available|

3-month execution cost: **$20–50/patient**, excluding concentrator. All components are **non-proprietary and field-adaptable**.

---

## 5. RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Oxygen overdose:** Low-flow capped, daily max enforced  
- **Supplement confusion:** Pre-packed starter bundles, clearly labeled  
- **Protocol misunderstanding:** Staff and peer orientation brief (~15 min)  
- **Cultural mismatch:** Locally translate tone, food, and framing  

---

## 6. DEPLOYMENT PATH

Can be activated by:  
- NGOs and mobile health workers  
- Clinics with access to oxygen units  
- Peer-led care circles  
- Remote villages using printed guides + local food kits  

**Delivery kit:** 1 print sheet/module, 1 supplement pouch, 1 treatment rhythm guide  
**No software or diagnosis gatekeeping required.**
