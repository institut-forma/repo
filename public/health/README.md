# Public Health Documents

Curated protocols and structural health references intended for open use—especially in contexts where systemic breakdown, immune drift, or environmental stress affect the body's baseline coherence.

Each document is written to be understandable, implementable, and useful across disciplines—without losing scientific depth.

- [`When Your Body No Longer Knows What’s Safe.pdf`](./When%20Your%20Body%20No%20Longer%20Knows%20What’s%20Safe.pdf)  
  *A calm, structured map of modern immune miscalibration. Explains how tolerance breaks down, why the body starts reacting to everything, and how to begin restoring clarity.*

Dry briefing on GALT structure and its collapse as an immune tolerance training system. Useful to immunologists, pharmacists, functional medics, and clinical generalists tracking systemic drift patterns. Includes Appendex A - Recovery Inputs and System Supports.

- [`GALT and the Loss of Immune Training.pdf`](./GALT%20and%20the%20Loss%20of%20Immune%20Training.pdf)  
- [`GALT and the Loss of Immune Training.docx`](./GALT%20and%20the%20Loss%20of%20Immune%20Training.docx)  
  
*Edit: It seems Long-covid could be linked to this. Post-viral tolerance failure mapped through mucosal degradation, vagal disruption, and SCFA suppression.*

*IU: Signature | Status: Signal Pulse* <!-- E wants the signal to be kept -A -->
