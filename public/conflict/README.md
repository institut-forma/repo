*Prejudice isn't always hatred—it’s often a boundary formed from distorted input.*

*Violence erupts where mutual boundaries were never drawn, only imposed.*

*Marginalization happens when systems don’t recognize or honor the internal contours of a person or group—so their sense of self gets overwritten.*

*Even in personal relationships: misalignment comes from misread or violated relational boundaries, not just “communication issues.”*
