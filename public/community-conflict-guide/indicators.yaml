# This file defines the metrics used to compute the **Coherence Score Φ**.
# Fill in one block per metric.  Each block must include:
#   weight   : relative importance (0–1). Weights should sum to 1.0.
#   target   : desired value or threshold.  Units explained in comments.
#   sense    : *How* the value is measured — sensor, survey, ledger, etc.
#   privacy  : YES/NO  — does raw data need redaction before publishing?
#   file     : path (inside data/processed/) to the latest CSV containing
#              a single column named `value`.  The score calculator reads
#              this file automatically.

# Example processed CSV format (data/processed/noise_dB_2025‑07‑09.csv):
