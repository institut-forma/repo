# Motion — Following the Slope

Motion is the visible trace of a system sliding down its Φᶜᵒʰ slope.

## 1. The Core Idea

- Every system wants to reduce its coherence cost Φᶜᵒʰ.  
- The steepest way down is given by the **gradient** `∇Φᶜᵒʰ`.  
- Motion is simply following that gradient.

## 2. From Rest to Flow

- A ball at rest on a slope stays still until a push moves it off balance.  
- Once moving, it keeps going until the slope flattens or another slope takes over.

## 3. Snap-to-Formula: General Motion

### 3.1 Coherence Force
```math
F^{coh}(x) = -\nabla \Phi^{coh}(x)
```
Slope in the coherence landscape becomes a force.

### 3.2 Newton’s Second Law
```math
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = F^{coh}(x)
```
Mass times acceleration equals the coherence force.

### 3.3 Damped Motion
```math
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{dx}{dt} = F^{coh}(x)
```
Real motion includes resistance `γ` — slopes can be slowed by friction or drag.

## 4. Motion in Different Contexts

- **Gravity** — objects follow the slope carved by mass.  
- **Electromagnetism** — charges follow the slope set by electric/magnetic fields.  
- **Learning systems** — parameters follow the slope of a loss function.

## 5. The Click

Once you see motion as slope-following,  
it’s easy to switch between physical, informational, or even social systems —  
the same rule applies: gradient → path → lock.
