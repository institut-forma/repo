# Motion — Following the Slope

Motion is the visible trace of a system sliding down its coherence slope `Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`.

## 1. The core idea

Every system has a “height map” of coherence potential.  
- **High** `Φᶜᵒʰ` → misaligned, wants to change.  
- **Low** `Φᶜᵒʰ` → aligned, stable.  
The steepest way to reduce `Φᶜᵒʰ` is given by the **gradient** `∇Φᶜᵒʰ`.  
Motion is simply following that slope.

## 2. From rest to flow

- A ball at rest on a slope won’t move until something nudges it off balance.  
- Once moving, it follows the slope — slowing down when it flattens, or changing direction if a new slope takes over.

## 3. Building the formulas for motion

### 3.1 Coherence force — turning slope into push

The gradient `∇Φᶜᵒʰ(x)` points uphill. To move toward alignment, we take the opposite direction:

```math
F^{coh}(x) = -\nabla \Phi^{coh}(x)
```

Here:  
- `F^{coh}(x)` is the **force** generated by the coherence slope.  
- The minus sign makes it point toward decreasing potential.

### 3.2 Newton’s second law — connecting force to motion

In physics, force links to motion through mass `m` and acceleration:

```math
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = F^{coh}(x)
```

- `m` = mass (resistance to acceleration).  
- `d²x/dt²` = acceleration (how quickly velocity changes).

### 3.3 Damped motion — adding resistance

Real systems rarely move without friction or drag. We add a damping term `γ`:

```math
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{dx}{dt} = F^{coh}(x)
```

- `γ (dx/dt)` = resistance proportional to speed.  
- Larger `γ` → stronger slowdown.

## 4. Motion in different contexts

The same slope–follow rule appears in many domains:  
- **Gravity** — objects follow the slope in spacetime caused by mass.  
- **Electromagnetism** — charges follow the slope of an electric or magnetic potential.  
- **Learning systems** — model parameters follow the slope of a loss function.  
- **Social systems** — opinions or agreements shift along an alignment slope.

## 5. The click

When you see motion as “slope-following,” you can jump between physics, information, or social change using the same mental model:  

**gradient → path → lock**.
