# Glossary of Ideas

A quick reference for every core word in λ-Mechanics.  
Read it once, then keep it nearby — each term will appear throughout the journey.

### **Alignment**
When parts of a system fit together in a way that reduces tension or mismatch.

### **Coherence**
The degree to which a system’s parts work together as one pattern.

### **Coherence Potential (Φᶜᵒʰ)**
A single number describing “how out-of-place” a system is.  
High Φᶜᵒʰ = misaligned, low Φᶜᵒʰ = aligned.

### **Descent**
The natural movement from higher Φᶜᵒʰ toward lower Φᶜᵒʰ — like rolling downhill.

### **Entropy**
A measure of how many possible arrangements a system can take.  
Systems tend to shift toward more possible arrangements.

### **Field**
A rulebook spread out in space, telling you “what tends to happen here.”

### **Gradient**
The direction and steepness of the biggest possible drop in Φᶜᵒʰ.

### **Interference**
When two or more waves or patterns overlap, building or canceling each other.

### **Lock**
A state where the system fits so well it resists change.

### **Mass**
How deep a system’s coherence well is — the stronger the lock, the heavier the mass.

### **Pattern**
A regular arrangement or shape you can recognize and describe.

### **Photon**
A particle of light that carries shape information without mass.

### **Potential Well**
A dip in Φᶜᵒʰ — the lower you go, the harder it is to leave.

### **Probability Weight**
The strength of a possible outcome in a quantum or statistical system.

### **Slope**
How quickly Φᶜᵒʰ changes in a given direction.

### **Snap-to-Formula**
The point where a clear pattern naturally turns into a precise equation.

### **Wavefunction**
A quantum object that encodes all possible states a system could be in.

**Tip:**  
If a definition feels abstract, look for its *Try-It* box in the matching chapter.  
The hands-on example will make it click.
