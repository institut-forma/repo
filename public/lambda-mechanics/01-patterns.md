# Patterns — The First Step

Before the math, there is the pattern.  
Recognizing patterns is how we first see the rules of the world.

## 1. Why Patterns Come First

Humans learn best by noticing shapes and changes before naming or measuring them.  
A clear pattern makes the later formula *click* instantly.

## 2. Common Physical Patterns

- **Slopes** — things roll or flow down.  
- **Waves** — ripples, sound, light.  
- **Cycles** — day/night, seasons, orbits.  
- **Spreads** — heat, smells, ripples in a pond.  
- **Locks** — magnets snapping together, puzzle pieces fitting.

## 3. Patterns as Slope Stories

Every pattern is a story about change:

- Where it *wants* to go (direction).  
- How fast it goes (steepness).  
- When it stops (lock).

## 4. Snap-to-Formula: Pattern → Gradient

From the visual to the symbolic:

### 4.1 Gradient
```math
\nabla f(x) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, ..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right)
```
Points toward the steepest change in `f(x)`.

### 4.2 Descent Step
```math
x_{new} = x_{old} - \eta \, \nabla f(x_{old})
```
A small step `η` down the slope.

## 5. The Click

Once you see the slope in the pattern,  
you can describe it in words, numbers, or equations —  
but the underlying story stays the same.
