# One Shape to Hold It All

By now you’ve seen the slope everywhere:  
in falling apples, cooling coffee, photon paths, quantum probabilities, and even galaxies.  

Here’s the unifying frame — the single shape all of them follow.

## 1. The Core Law  

Every system has a **coherence potential** `Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`.  
It’s a single number telling you how “out-of-place” the system is in its current state `x`.  
The system changes in the direction that makes this number drop fastest.  

### 1.1 Coherence Force  
```math
F^{coh}(x) = -
abla \Phi^{coh}(x)
```
**Breaking it down (left → right):**  
- **`F^{coh}(x)`** — coherence force at state `x`; drives the change.  
- **`=`** — both sides describe the same thing.  
- **`-∇Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`** — negative gradient of the coherence potential; points toward steepest decrease in misalignment.  

**Meaning:** Works like conservative forces from a potential `V(x)`, but the scalar driver is *alignment cost*.  
When `∇Φᶜᵒʰ = 0`, the system is at a lock point.

## 2. The Path Story

Some systems change over time, with costs adding up along a path.  
This gives us the time-dependent form:  

### 2.1 Time-Dependent Formulation
```math
\Phi^{coh}(x) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \mathcal{C}(x(	au), \dot{x}(	au), R(	au)) \, d	au
```
**Breaking it down (left → right):**  
- **`Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`** — total coherence cost of the path up to time `t`.  
- **`=`** — equality; left and right are the same quantity.  
- **`∫_{t₀}^t`** — integrate from the start time `t₀` to current time `t`.  
- **`𝒞(x(τ), ẋ(τ), R(τ))`** — coherence cost density at each moment:  
  - `x(τ)` = state at time `τ`.  
  - `ẋ(τ)` (x-dot) = rate of change of the state — velocity.  
  - `R(τ)` = reference frame or constraints at time `τ`.  
- **`dτ`** — add up cost over small time slices.  

**Meaning:** This is the path-integral view — the system follows a trajectory that minimizes total misalignment, giving Euler–Lagrange conditions (like least action in physics).

## 3. Step-by-Step Change

In many cases, we follow the slope in discrete jumps:  

### 3.1 Discrete Update Rule (λ–Δ Formulation)
| Symbol | Definition      | Role                                          |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `λ(x)` | `−∇Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`    | Steepest descent direction in coherence space |
| `Δx`   | `η·λ(x)`        | Step of size `η` along `λ`                    |

**Meaning:** Small steps in the steepest direction shrink Φᶜᵒʰ until the system reaches a lock point.

## 4. Cross-Domain Snap Table

| Domain       | Pattern                | Φᶜᵒʰ Meaning               | Snap Equation                              |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Motion       | Rolling down a slope   | Gravitational potential     | `F = −∇Φᶜᵒʰ`                              |
| Heat Flow    | Evening out gradients  | Thermal mismatch            | `q ∝ −∇T`                                 |
| Light Path   | Least optical distance | Phase/polarization mismatch | `∇Φᶜᵒʰ = 0` → Fermat’s principle           |
| Quantum      | Interference pattern   | Probability misalignment    | Schrödinger eq. as slope in Hilbert space  |
| Learning     | Loss minimization      | Error in predictions        | Gradient descent on loss `L`               |
| Society      | Conflict resolution    | Misalignment of goals       | Consensus dynamics = slope toward minima   |

## 5. The Click

Once you see **slope → descent → lock**,  
you can predict how any system will evolve.  
The details (forces, fields, statistics, negotiations)  
are just different kinds of **Φᶜᵒʰ** landscapes.  

Hold this shape, and you hold the thread through all physics — and far beyond.
