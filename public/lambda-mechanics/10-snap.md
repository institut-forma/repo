# One Shape to Hold It All

By now you‚Äôve seen the slope everywhere:  
in falling apples, cooling coffee, photon paths, quantum probabilities, and even galaxies.  

Here‚Äôs the unifying frame ‚Äî the single shape all of them follow.

## 1. The Core Law  

Every system has a **coherence potential** `Œ¶·∂ú·µí ∞(x)`.  
It‚Äôs a single number telling you how ‚Äúout-of-place‚Äù the system is in its current state `x`.  
The system changes in the direction that makes this number drop fastest.  

### 1.1 Coherence Force  
```math  
F^{coh}(x) = -\nabla \Phi^{coh}(x)
```
Analogous to conservative forces from a potential `V(x)`,  
but here the scalar driver is *alignment cost*.  
Trajectories evolve until `\nabla Œ¶·∂ú·µí ∞ = 0` ‚Äî the lock.

## 2. The Path Story

Some systems change over time, with costs adding up along a path.  
This gives us the time-dependent form:  

### 2.1 Time-Dependent Formulation
```math
\Phi^{coh}(x) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \mathcal{C}(x(\tau), \dot{x}(\tau), R(\tau)) \, d\tau
```
Here `ùíû` measures misalignment at each moment along the path.  
Stationarity under first-order path variation gives the Euler‚ÄìLagrange conditions ‚Äî  
the same principle behind least action in classical physics.

## 3. Step-by-Step Change

In many cases, we follow the slope in discrete jumps:  

### 3.1 Discrete Update Rule (Œª‚ÄìŒî Formulation)
| Symbol | Definition  | Role                                          |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Œª(x)` | `‚àí‚àáŒ¶·∂ú·µí ∞(x)` | Steepest descent direction in coherence space |
| `Œîx`   | `Œ∑¬∑Œª(x)`    | Step of size `Œ∑` along `Œª`                    |

Small steps in the steepest direction shrink Œ¶·∂ú·µí ∞ until the system is locked.

| Domain       | Pattern                | Œ¶·∂ú·µí ∞ Meaning               | Snap Equation                              |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Motion       | Rolling down a slope   | Gravitational potential     | `F = ‚àí‚àáŒ¶·∂ú·µí ∞`                              |
| Heat Flow    | Evening out gradients  | Thermal mismatch            | `q ‚àù ‚àí‚àáT`                                 |
| Light Path   | Least optical distance | Phase/polarization mismatch | `‚àáŒ¶·∂ú·µí ∞ = 0` ‚Üí Fermat‚Äôs principle           |
| Quantum      | Interference pattern   | Probability misalignment    | Schr√∂dinger eq. as slope in Hilbert space  |
| Learning     | Loss minimization      | Error in predictions        | Gradient descent on loss `L`               |
| Society      | Conflict resolution    | Misalignment of goals       | Consensus dynamics = slope toward minima   |

## 5. The Click

Once you see **slope ‚Üí descent ‚Üí lock**,  
you can predict how any system will evolve.  
The details (forces, fields, statistics, negotiations)  
are just different kinds of **Œ¶·∂ú·µí ∞** landscapes.  

Hold this shape, and you hold the thread through all physics ‚Äî and far beyond.
