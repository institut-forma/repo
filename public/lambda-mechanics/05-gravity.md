# Gravity — Deep Wells in the Coherence Map

Gravity is the steepest and most universal slope in Φᶜᵒʰ.  
It turns mass into a deep well that everything nearby slides toward.

## 1. The Pattern

- **Mass** = depth of the well.  
- Bigger mass → deeper well → stronger pull.  
- The slope’s shape is the same for falling apples and orbiting moons.

## 2. Wells and Motion

Imagine marbles on a stretched sheet:  
- A heavy marble makes a dip.  
- Other marbles roll toward it.  
- No ropes, no magnets — just the slope.

## 3. Snap-to-Formula: Newton’s Form

### 3.1 Gravitational Potential
```math
\Phi^{grav}(r) = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
```
Two masses `m₁` and `m₂` separated by distance `r`.

### 3.2 Force from the Potential
```math
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \Phi^{grav} = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}
```
The slope of the potential gives the Newtonian pull.

## 4. Mass as Locked Coherence

In Φᶜᵒʰ language, mass measures **how much of the system’s structure is locked in place**.  
Deeper lock → deeper well.

### 4.1 Mass from Coherence
```math
m \propto \int_{X_{obj}} C(x, \dot{x}, R) \, d\mu(x)
```
The integral sums the system’s coherence cost over its extent.

## 5. Relativity’s Slope

Einstein’s view: mass and energy curve spacetime.  
Objects follow the straightest paths in that curved space.

### 5.1 Geodesic Equation
```math
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0
```
`Γ` encodes curvature; the slope lives in spacetime itself.

## 6. The Click

Gravity isn’t a force pulling at a distance —  
it’s the shape of the well in the coherence landscape.  
Everything moves along that shape toward alignment.
