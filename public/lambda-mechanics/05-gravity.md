# Gravity — Deep Wells in the Coherence Map

Gravity is one of the steepest and most universal slopes in the coherence map `Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`.
It transforms mass into a deep well that nearby objects naturally slide toward.

## 1. The pattern

- **Mass** determines the depth of the well.  
- Larger mass → deeper well → stronger pull.  
- The slope’s shape is the same for a falling apple or an orbiting moon — only the scale changes.

## 2. Wells and motion

Picture a stretched rubber sheet:  
- A heavy ball makes a deep dip.  
- Smaller balls placed nearby roll toward it.  
- No strings, no magnets — just the slope in the surface.

This is an analogy for how mass shapes the space around it.

## 3. Building the formulas — Newton’s view

### 3.1 Gravitational potential — depth of the well

```math
\Phi^{grav}(r) = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
```

- `m₁`, `m₂` = the two interacting masses.  
- `r` = distance between their centers.  
- `G` = gravitational constant.

### 3.2 Force from the potential — slope into pull

```math
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \Phi^{grav} = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}
```

- The gradient `∇Φᵍʳᵃᵛ` measures how steep the potential is.  
- The minus sign means the pull is toward smaller `r`.  
- `r̂` is a **unit vector** — an arrow of length 1 — pointing from one mass to the other.

## 4. Mass as locked coherence

In `Φᶜᵒʰ` terms, mass measures **how much of a system’s structure is fixed in place** — its locked-in alignment cost.  
The more locked-in, the deeper the well it creates.

### 4.1 Mass from coherence — a structural measure

```math
m \propto \int_{X_{obj}} C(x, \dot{x}, R) \, d\mu(x)
```

- Integration over the object’s extent `X_obj`.  
- `C(x, ẋ, R)` = coherence cost density (cost at each point in the object).  
- `ẋ` (read “x-dot”) = rate of change of position — velocity.  
- `dμ(x)` = volume measure over the object.

## 5. Relativity’s slope — spacetime curvature

Einstein’s general relativity says: mass and energy **curve spacetime**, and objects move along the straightest possible paths in that curved space.  
These “straightest possible” paths are called **geodesics**.

### 5.1 Geodesic equation — the path in curved space

```math
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0
```

Breaking it down:

- `x^μ` — the position in spacetime (μ = time or one of the space directions).  
- `τ` — proper time measured by the object itself along its path.  
- `Γ^μ_{αβ}` — Christoffel symbols, which encode how spacetime is curved at each point.  
- `dx^α/dτ` — velocity through spacetime.  
- `d²x^μ/dτ²` — acceleration through spacetime.  

**Meaning:** The curvature term `Γ^μ_{αβ}` bends what would be a straight-line path, so motion follows the geometry rather than being “pushed” by a force.

## 6. The click

Gravity isn’t a mysterious pull at a distance —  
it’s simply the **shape of the well** in the coherence landscape.  
All motion in its influence is just sliding along that shape toward alignment.
