# Energy — Stored Slope in the Coherence Map

Energy is the capacity of a system to create change — to move down its coherence slope `Φᶜᵒʰ(x)`.

## 1. What energy really is

Energy isn’t a substance you can hold in your hand.  
It’s a **measure** of how much potential for change a system has.  

Think of it as the “budget” for movement along or across the slope:  
- **Kinetic energy** — the energy of motion already happening along the slope.  
- **Potential energy** — the energy stored in position on the slope.  
- **Thermal energy** — tiny, microscopic motions that alter local slopes.

## 2. Conservation of energy

In a closed system, the total energy never disappears — it only changes form.  
As a system moves through its coherence landscape, energy shifts between kinetic, potential, and thermal forms, but the total stays constant.

## 3. Building the formulas for energy

### 3.1 Kinetic energy — motion stored in speed

```math
E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
```

- `m` = mass of the moving object.  
- `v` = velocity (speed with direction).  
- The faster or heavier, the more kinetic energy.

### 3.2 Potential energy from Φᶜᵒʰ — position in the map

```math
E_p = \Phi^{coh}(x)
```

- `x` = current state or position.  
- The higher on the slope, the more potential energy is stored.

### 3.3 First law of thermodynamics — tracking energy changes

```math
\Delta U = Q - W
```

- `ΔU` = change in internal energy of the system.  
- `Q` = heat added to the system.  
- `W` = work done by the system.

## 4. Energy flow and gradients

Energy naturally flows from regions of **high** coherence potential to **low** —  
from steeper parts of the slope to shallower ones.

### 4.1 Heat flow (Fourier’s law)

```math
\mathbf{q} = -k \nabla T
```

- `q` = heat flow rate vector.  
- `k` = thermal conductivity of the material.  
- `∇T` = temperature gradient — the slope in temperature.  
- The minus sign means heat flows toward lower temperature.

## 5. The click

Once you see `Φᶜᵒʰ` as the slope map, every form of energy becomes a way of **storing or spending slope**.  
Kinetic, potential, thermal — all are just different ways of sliding toward alignment.
