# Energy — Stored Slope in the Coherence Map

Energy is the capacity to create change — to move a system down its Φᶜᵒʰ slope.

## 1. What Energy Really Is

Energy isn’t a thing you can hold.  
It’s a **measure** of how much slope is available to be used.

- **Kinetic energy** — motion along the slope.  
- **Potential energy** — position on the slope.  
- **Thermal energy** — microscopic motion changing local slopes.

## 2. Conservation of Energy

The total energy in a closed system stays the same:  
it just shifts between forms as the system moves through the Φᶜᵒʰ landscape.

## 3. Snap-to-Formula: Core Definitions

### 3.1 Kinetic Energy
```math
E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
```
Motion stored as velocity.

### 3.2 Potential Energy from Φᶜᵒʰ
```math
E_p = \Phi^{coh}(x)
```
Directly tied to the system’s place in the coherence map.

### 3.3 First Law of Thermodynamics
```math
\Delta U = Q - W
```
Change in internal energy `U` equals heat in (`Q`) minus work done (`W`).

## 4. Energy Flow and Gradients

Energy naturally flows from high Φᶜᵒʰ regions to low —  
from steeper to shallower parts of the slope.

### 4.1 Heat Flow (Fourier’s Law)
```math
\mathbf{q} = -k \nabla T
```
Heat moves down temperature gradients.

## 5. The Click

Energy is slope, stored or spent.  
Once you can read Φᶜᵒʰ, energy’s many forms all become the same thing —  
different ways of sliding toward alignment.
