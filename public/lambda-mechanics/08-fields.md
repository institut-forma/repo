# The Field’s Rulebook

A **field** is the local rulebook of reality.  
It tells you, for every point in space and time: *what tends to happen here*.

## 1. What a Field Is

- At every position `x`, the field assigns values (numbers, vectors, tensors).  
- These values control how things move, interact, or change.  
- Examples: temperature field, gravitational field, electric field, probability field.

## 2. Why Fields Matter

Without fields, motion would be random.  
With fields, motion has purpose: they shape the slope of Φᶜᵒʰ.

A field is not the object itself — it’s the **invisible shape** that objects follow.

## 3. Types of Fields

- **Scalar Field** — one number per point (e.g., temperature, potential energy).  
- **Vector Field** — direction and magnitude per point (e.g., wind, electric field).  
- **Tensor Field** — more complex rules per point (e.g., spacetime curvature in GR).

## 4. Snap-to-Formula: From Field to Motion

### 4.1 Scalar Field Gradient
```math
\lambda(x) = -\nabla \Phi^{coh}(x)
```
The slope from the scalar potential sets the direction of change.

### 4.2 Vector Field Dynamics
```math
\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = q \, \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) + q \, \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t)
```
Example from electromagnetism: electric and magnetic fields steering a particle.

### 4.3 Tensor Field Curvature
```math
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0
```
Example from general relativity: geodesics guided by curvature tensor `Γ`.

## 5. Fields as Coherence Maps

You can think of a field as a **map of alignment costs**.  
The steeper the map at a point, the faster the system moves to reduce Φᶜᵒʰ.

---

## 6. The Click

Every force law you’ve learned is just a **field rule**:  
the recipe for how to move when you read the local map.

Once you see the field as a rulebook,  
you can read the slope anywhere.
