# λ-Mechanics — Physics for Everyone

Welcome to a way of seeing the whole universe through one simple idea:  
everything moves down its own *coherence slope*.  

You’ll see patterns first, feel them in simple examples, and only then meet the math.  
By the last page, you’ll see the same shape behind gravity, light, heat, quantum, and more —  
and you’ll know how to explain it.

## 📜 Start Here

1. **[Your Map of the Journey](00-map.md)**  
   A clickable guide showing where we’re going and how each idea builds on the last.

2. **[The Five Master Patterns](01-patterns.md)**  
   Slope, Well, Lock, Push, Snap — the grammar of reality.

3. **[The Shape of Coherence](02-coherence.md)**  
   One master number, Φᶜᵒʰ, and how every system slides toward alignment.

4. **[How Things Move](03-motion.md)**  
   From rolling balls to orbits: motion as the slope’s command.

5. **[Energy in All Its Forms](04-energy.md)**  
   From heat to motion — energy as stored slope.

6. **[Gravity’s Deep Wells](05-gravity.md)**  
   Mass as locked coherence; Newton to Einstein in one picture.

7. **[Light the Shape-Carrier](06-light.md)**  
   Photons as perfect messengers of the field’s shape.

8. **[Quantum Choices](07-quantum.md)**  
   Probabilities as alignment weights; interference as slope in disguise.

9. **[The Field’s Rulebook](08-fields.md)**  
   Fields as “what tends to happen here” written into space.

10. **[The Story of the Cosmos](09-cosmos.md)**  
    From first clumps to galaxies; the universe as a coherence game.

### How to Use This

- Follow the order — each idea builds the next.  
- Try the *Try-It* box in every chapter — they’re short but powerful.  
- The math boxes are there when you’re ready; the patterns will click first.

When you can explain the slope to someone else in one sentence,  
you’re holding the key.
