# Quantum Choices — Exploring Possibility Space

Quantum mechanics is the story of how systems explore all their possible states,  
weighted by alignment with the rules of their world.

## 1. The quantum view

Instead of following a single path, a quantum system is described by a **wavefunction** `ψ(x, t)`  
that contains *all possible outcomes* and how strongly each is weighted.

- **Amplitude** → how strong the possibility is.  
- **Phase** → how it interferes with other possibilities.

## 2. Coherence in quantum systems

In quantum terms, `Φᶜᵒʰ` measures **misalignment in probability space**.  
Interference patterns form when multiple possible paths lower `Φᶜᵒʰ` together.

## 3. From slopes to Schrödinger

The wavefunction changes over time so that probability flows toward more aligned states.

### 3.1 Schrödinger equation — slope in Hilbert space

```math
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \, \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
```

Breaking it down (left → right):

- `i` — the imaginary unit (√−1), used because wavefunctions carry phase information.  
- `ħ` — reduced Planck’s constant; sets the scale of quantum effects.  
- `∂/∂t ψ(r, t)` — the rate of change of the wavefunction over time.  
- `ψ(𝐫, t)` — the wavefunction; `𝐫` is the position vector in space, `t` is time.  
- `Ĥ` — the Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system.  
- `=` — equality; both sides describe the same evolution.  

**Meaning:** The Hamiltonian sets the slope in the abstract space of all possible states (Hilbert space),  
and the wavefunction `ψ` evolves by sliding along it.

## 4. Measurement and lock

A **measurement** is when the system locks into one definite outcome.  
The wavefunction *collapses* to the state most aligned with the measurement setup.

## 5. Interference as slope play

### 5.1 Double-slit pattern

- Two open paths → two sets of probability waves.  
- **Peaks** = constructive interference → lower `Φᶜᵒʰ`.  
- **Valleys** = destructive interference → higher `Φᶜᵒʰ`.

---

## 6. Snap-to-formula: probabilities

### 6.1 Born rule — reading the wavefunction

```math
P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2
```

Breaking it down:

- `ψ(x)` — the wavefunction evaluated at position `x`.  
- `|ψ(x)|` — magnitude (size) of the complex number `ψ(x)`, ignoring phase.  
- Squaring it gives the probability density at `x`.  
- Always positive and normalized so the total probability sums to 1.

**Meaning:** The probability of finding the system at `x` comes from the square of the wavefunction’s amplitude there.

## 7. The click

Quantum isn’t “random” in the everyday sense —  
it’s rule-following in a landscape of possibilities.  

The same slope → descent → lock logic holds here as in the rest of physics.  
Once you can see `Φᶜᵒʰ` in Hilbert space, quantum mechanics feels like another familiar slope story.
