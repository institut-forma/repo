# Quantum Choices

Quantum mechanics is the story of how systems explore all their possible states,  
weighted by alignment with the rules of their world.

## 1. The Quantum View

Instead of a single path, quantum systems carry a **wavefunction** `ψ(x, t)`.  
This wavefunction encodes all possible outcomes and their weights.

- **Amplitude** → how strong the possibility is.  
- **Phase** → how it interferes with other possibilities.

## 2. Coherence in Quantum Systems

Φᶜᵒʰ in quantum terms measures **misalignment in probability space**.  
Interference patterns appear when multiple paths try to lower Φᶜᵒʰ together.

---

## 3. From Slopes to Schrödinger

The wavefunction changes so that probability flows toward more aligned states.

### 3.1 Schrödinger Equation
```math
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
```
The Hamiltonian `Ĥ` sets the slope in Hilbert space; `ψ` slides along it.

---

## 4. Measurement and Lock

A measurement is the moment the system **locks** into one outcome.  
The wavefunction collapses to the state most aligned with the measurement setup.

---

## 5. Interference as Slope Play

### 5.1 Double-Slit Pattern
- Two paths → two sets of probability waves.  
- Peaks = constructive interference (lower Φᶜᵒʰ).  
- Valleys = destructive interference (higher Φᶜᵒʰ).

---

## 6. Snap-to-Formula: Probabilities

### 6.1 Born Rule
```math
P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2
```
Probability is the squared amplitude — always positive, always sums to 1.

## 7. The Click

Quantum isn’t random — it’s rule-following in possibility space.  
The same slope–descent–lock logic holds, just in a different landscape.

Once you can see Φᶜᵒʰ in Hilbert space,  
quantum mechanics feels like the rest of physics.
