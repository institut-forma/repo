# Light — The Shape-Carrier

Light doesn’t push or pull the way matter does.  
Instead, it **reads** the shape of the surrounding field and changes its own form to match.

## 1. What photons do

- **Carry energy and momentum** — they can transfer these to matter.  
- **Carry shape information** — phase, polarization, wavelength, and amplitude.  
- **Follow alignment** — they move along paths that make their coherence potential Φᶜᵒʰ stationary.

## 2. The slope for light

For light, the “slope” isn’t just about where it is in space.  
It’s about **phase** (how the wave crests align) and **polarization** (the wave’s orientation).  
Changes in either will change Φᶜᵒʰ, even if the energy stays the same.

## 3. Building the formula — Fermat’s Principle

### 3.1 Statement

Light takes the path that makes the **optical path length** stationary.

```math
\delta \int n(s) \, ds = 0
```

Breaking it down (left → right):

- `∫ n(s) ds` — the optical path length.  
    - `n(s)` = refractive index at position `s` along the path (how much slower light moves there compared to vacuum).  
    - `ds` = small element of physical distance along the path.  
- `δ` — variation; we’re looking for the path where a tiny change doesn’t make the total path length shorter or longer.  
- `= 0` — the stationary condition: this is the path light actually follows.

**Meaning:** Among all possible paths, light chooses one where its optical distance doesn’t change for small variations — a “slope balance” in optical space.

## 4. Polarization and phase — light’s internal slope

When light interacts with matter or passes through certain materials,  
its **polarization** `θ` and **phase** `φ` can rotate or shift.

These changes alter Φᶜᵒʰ without necessarily changing the light’s energy.

### 4.1 Photon coherence cost

```math
C_{photon}(x, R) = \|\Delta \theta\| + \|\Delta \phi\| + \|\Delta p\|
```

Breaking it down:

- `Δθ` — change in polarization angle.  
- `Δφ` — change in phase.  
- `Δp` — change in momentum (direction or magnitude).  
- `‖…‖` — magnitude of the change.  
- `C_photon(x, R)` — total “misalignment cost” for a photon relative to a reference state `R`.

## 5. Photons as perfect listeners

Photons have **no inertia** — they react instantly to the slope of the field.  
They follow Φᶜᵒʰ exactly, with no lag, making them perfect messengers of the field’s shape.

## 6. The click

Once you see light as a **shape-carrier**,  
you stop thinking of it as only “waves” or “particles.”  
It’s a **real-time reader** of Φᶜᵒʰ, tracing the most aligned path available —  
whether through empty space, glass, or curved spacetime itself.
