# Light — The Shape-Carrier

Light doesn’t push the way matter does.  
Instead, it **reads** the shape of the field and changes its own form to match.

## 1. What Photons Do

- Carry energy and momentum.  
- Carry *shape information* — phase, polarization, wavelength.  
- Travel along paths that make their Φᶜᵒʰ stationary.

## 2. The Slope for Light

For light, the slope isn’t about position alone — it’s about **phase** and **polarization**.  
When these change, Φᶜᵒʰ shifts.

## 3. Snap-to-Formula: Fermat’s Principle

### 3.1 Least Optical Distance
```math
\delta \int n(s) \, ds = 0
```
Light takes the path that makes the optical path length stationary.  
`n(s)` = refractive index along the path.

---

## 4. Polarization and Phase

When light interacts with materials,  
its polarization `θ` and phase `φ` can rotate — changing its Φᶜᵒʰ without losing energy.

### 4.1 Photon Coherence Cost
```math
C_{photon}(x, R) = \|\Delta\theta\| + \|\Delta\phi\| + \|\Delta p\|
```
Total change in polarization, phase, and momentum.

## 5. Photons as Perfect Listeners

Photons follow the slope **exactly** — no inertia, no delay.  
They are ideal messengers of the field’s shape.

## 6. The Click

Once you see light as a **shape-carrier**,  
you stop thinking of it as just “waves” or “particles.”  
It’s a real-time reader of Φᶜᵒʰ, tracing the most aligned path available.
