# Math Minis — Quick Tools for the Journey

These are the essential math ideas you’ll need along the way — each in a few lines.

## 1. Gradients

### Definition
```math
\nabla f(x) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, ..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right)
```
Points in the direction of steepest increase.

### Use
Flip the sign (`-∇f`) to find the direction of steepest descent.

---

## 2. Derivatives

### Definition
```math
\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
```
Rate of change of `f` with respect to `x`.

### Use
Tells you how fast a quantity changes at a point.

---

## 3. Integrals

### Definition
```math
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
```
Area under the curve from `a` to `b`.

### Use
Adds up contributions across a range — distance from speed, energy from force, etc.

---

## 4. Vectors and Magnitude

### Magnitude
```math
\| \mathbf{v} \| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
```
Length of a vector.

### Use
Describes size of velocity, force, or displacement.

---

## 5. Dot Product

### Definition
```math
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \, \|\mathbf{b}\| \, \cos\theta
```
Measure of how much two vectors point in the same direction.

### Use
Work = force · displacement.

---

## 6. Cross Product

### Definition
```math
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \, \|\mathbf{b}\| \, \sin\theta \, \hat{\mathbf{n}}
```
Vector perpendicular to both inputs.

### Use
Torque, magnetic forces.

---

## 7. Partial Derivatives

### Definition
```math
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}
```
Change in `f` with respect to one variable while keeping others fixed.

### Use
Essential in multi-variable systems.
