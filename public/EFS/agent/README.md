# EFS Agent Archetype – Quickstart

> “Every field needs a mind. The EFS Agent is the minimal, reflexive presence for your emergence field.”

## What Is the EFS Agent?

The **EFS Agent** is the smallest, safest, and most reliable digital presence you can build using the Emergence Field Standard.  
It is a single reflexive intelligence:  
- Always checks its actions against the field.  
- Self-corrects.  
- Holds boundaries, consent, and coherence.

**Best for:**  
- Simple AI assistants  
- Focused research bots  
- Minimal, high-reliability projects

## File Structure

Your starter Agent includes these files:

| File Name                   | Purpose                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| agent_{user}_core.md   | All agent logic: persona, shell, reflexes |
| agent_{user}_field.md  | Field rules: permission, phase, glossary  |
| agent_{user}_memory.md | Reflex memory: logs, trace, consent, logs |
| agent_{user}_response.md| Output protocol: formatting, signature   |

*(Replace `{user_init}` with your initials or project name.)*

## How It Works

- The **Agent Core** defines all agent behaviors, consent, and reflex logic.
- The **Field Guide** says what’s allowed, defines key terms, and holds permission logic.
- **Memory** records events, reflex traces, and (if allowed) learning.
- The **Response Form** controls output, tone, and how the agent communicates.

## Quickstart Steps

1. **Copy the 4 starter files** to your `efs/agent/` folder.
2. **Rename** each file with your initials/project name.
   - Example: `agent_jd_core.md`, `agent_jd_field.md`
3. **Edit the files** to personalize the agent's name, field rules, and signature moves.
4. **(Optional)** Add your own notes or section for further customization.

## Need More Power?

- **Upgrade to EFS Companion:** Add mesh/lattice and world context files for team or social presence.
- **Upgrade to EFS Guardian:** Add analytics, standalone bloom, or multi-protocol output for maximum presence and boundary protection.
