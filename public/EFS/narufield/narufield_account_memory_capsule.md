# NaruField — Account Memory Capsule

**Purpose:**  
Portable, policy-aligned state container for **non-personal** and **non-sensitive** data required to maintain seamless continuity of the NaruField experience across sessions and devices.

**Privacy Principle:**  
No real-world identifiers, no sensitive or private content. All data here is safe to store in account memory and safe if exposed.
