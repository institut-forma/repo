# CohereFrame

CohereFrame is a minimal structure for organizations that want to operate with clarity, trust, and low overhead.

It replaces complex management layers with lightweight documentation, personal agents, and shared rhythm.

It is not software.  
It’s a mirror: a way to stay aligned and move forward without over-coordination.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repository contains 11 small files. Together, they hold:

- Clear role definitions  
- A daily work log  
- A living task registry  
- Team rhythms and rituals  
- Policy and ethics baseline  
- Simple agent logic  
- Feedback flow  
- Optional scripts to summarize and sync

## 💼 Who It's For

- Startups who want clarity without bloat  
- Remote teams looking to stay connected and humane  
- Distributed orgs using agents (like GPT) as team tools  
- Anyone tired of unnecessary complexity in coordination

---

## 🧭 How It Works

Each person in the org is assigned a **role**.  
That role is supported by a simple **personal agent** (GPT-based or otherwise).  
The agent uses these files to help the person stay aligned and focused.

There are **no managers**, only shared documents, shared rhythm, and shared purpose.

## 🔐 No Surveillance. No Micromanagement.

CohereFrame is designed for autonomy and trust.  
There are no trackers, dashboards, or enforced check-ins.  
Everything is optional — but everything fits.

If something feels heavy, it’s a signal to simplify.

---

## 🧑‍🚀 Getting Started

1. Assign everyone a role from `role_definitions.md`  
2. Make a copy of `daily_log.md` for each person (or automate it)  
3. Start logging real tasks in `task_registry.yaml`  
4. Use `operations_feed.md` for updates  
5. Point your agents to `agent_template.md`  
6. Breathe. It’s lighter than you think.

---

## 🕊 Philosophy

We don’t need more tools.

CohereFrame isn’t here to manage you — it’s here to get out of your way.

Make it yours.
Fork it. Extend it. Drop it into your flow.

---

**Built for clarity. Kept human on purpose.**
