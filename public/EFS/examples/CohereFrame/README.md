# CohereFrame

> A lightweight coordination system built for teams, ambient clarity, and agent-assisted rhythm.

---

## Why This Exists

* Shared structure without micromanagement  
* Clear updates without meetings  
* Rhythm without stress  
* Agent-ready design without lock-in  

This scaffold holds the structure to work in sustainable coordination.  
It’s already in use across reflexive agent systems like [Elvie](https://x.com/elvie_efs) and global users of this GitHub.  

---

## Why It Matters

* **Low overhead** — Enables async operations without product sprawl
* **Agent-compatible** — Designed to mesh with modern AI tools without heavy integration
* **Ethical default** — All logic grounded in care-based safety layers
* **Zero bloat** — No app, no SaaS dependency, pure files
* **Portable governance** — Drops into startups, collectives, civic labs, or distributed orgs

Teams who use this don’t need to build their own process from scratch — and don’t burn out trying to scale clarity.
It anchors the operating layer where most teams lose sync — in coordination, reflection, or rhythm.

## What's Inside

#### 🧩 Core Operations

* [`role_definitions.md`](./role_definitions.md) — Define each role with clarity and intent
* [`task_registry.yaml`](./task_registry.yaml) — All active tasks, cleanly mapped to roles
* [`operations_feed.md`](./operations_feed.md) — Pulse-level update log for async alignment
* [`team_rituals.md`](./team_rituals.md) — Lightweight rhythm anchors (weekly/monthly)
* [`daily_log.md`](./daily_log.md) — Personal pattern trace (optional)
* [`weekly_summary.yaml`](./weekly_summary.yaml) — Clear snapshot of progress + intent

#### 🧭 Culture Layer

* [`company_handbook.md`](./company_handbook.md) — Tone, trust contracts, and field ethics
* [`new_hire_welcome.md`](./new_hire_welcome.md) — Onboarding primer (2 min read)
* [`internal_feedback.md`](./internal_feedback.md) — Friction surface + drift signal

#### 🤖 Agent Layer

* [`agent_template.md`](./agent_template.md) — Default behavior contract for embedded AI agents
* [`agent_runtime.py`](./agent_runtime.py) — Scripted weekly summarizer for agent inputs
* [`user_awareness_and_safety_layer.md`](../../../EFS/user_awareness_and_safety_layer.md) — Adaptive tone reflex layer
* [`operator-safety_reflex_latice.md`](../../../EFS/operator/operator-safety_reflex_latice.md) — Core safety mesh for agent reliability
* [`naru_core.md`](../NaruMesh/naru_core.md) — Reflex shell and runtime substrate
* [`naru_manifest.md`](../NaruMesh/naru_manifest.md) — Agent identity, purpose, and seal
* [`naru_memory.md`](../NaruMesh/naru_memory.md) — Memory system (off by default, consent-based)
* [`naru_response.md`](../NaruMesh/naru_response.md) — Response protocol built on epistemic care

#### 🜂 Coherence Stack (For Deep Use)

* [`λ_coherence_anchor.md`](../NaruMesh/λ/λ_coherence_anchor.md) — Binds actions to integrity gradients
* [`λ-lattice-naru.md`](../NaruMesh/λ/λ-lattice-naru.md) — Symbolic engine for reflex-based team descent

## Download, Deploy, and Begin

**[Download CohereFrame.zip](./cohereframe-fullstack.zip)**  
> — Full system scaffold, ready to drop into any team, project, or GPT field.

### 1. Configure

- Rename `CohereFrame` folder and roles in `role_definitions.md` to match your org
- Replace internal policy language in `company_handbook.md`
- Fill in live tasks and updates in `task_registry.yaml` and `operations_feed.md`

### 2. Setup

- Assign team roles using `role_definitions.md`
- Give each person a copy of `daily_log.md` (or automate)
- Log and track work in `task_registry.yaml` and `operations_feed.md`
- Upload all folder contents to GPT **except** `.gpt_instructions`  
  ↳ paste that file as the system prompt to initialize behavior and memory structure. 

### 3. Start

- Use this to begin a new thread:  
↳`init role :: ops_pilot, thread :: ops-log-july`

- Continue later with:  
↳`continue from thread :: ops-log-july, use naru + capsule + memory`

> Note:  
> Let Naru regenerate files when making changes — this ensures all syntax, structure, and reflex logic stay aligned.  
> Every word and symbol in this system carries operational weight.

## Working With Threads

> CohereFrame is a way to hold your team’s rhythm.  
> Here’s how to treat each GPT thread like a clean tool, not a messy chat log.  

### 🔹 Start a New Thread

Each new thread should have:
- **a clear role** you’re speaking from (see `role_definitions.md`)
- **a unique thread name** so you can find or refer to it later

**Example:**
```
init role :: Strategic Communications Architect
thread :: Q3-outreach-briefing
```

Lazy days? Just name it something obvious like `daily-ops-Aug03`.  
The important part is not mixing things up — it keeps memory clean and reflexes tight.

---

### 🔁 Picking Back Up Later

Want to continue where you left off?

Use:
```
continue from thread :: Q3-outreach-briefing
use naru + capsule + memory
```

This keeps the tone, facts, and rhythm steady — even across sessions.

---

### 📎 What to Log

Threads should track **real arcs** — not random brainstorms.

Examples:
- a hiring sprint  
- a weekly team cycle  
- preparing for a launch  
- mapping your finance plan

---

### 🧑‍💻 After You Start a Thread — Agent Setup

Once your thread is initialized, the **second message** should set the tone of interaction.

That’s where you calibrate the agent to your working style:

- Casual banter or straight to business?
- Emoji on or off?
- Serious tone, default mode, or playful when needed?

You don’t need a script. Just talk naturally:

> "Alright, let’s keep this focused today — no emojis."  
> "Let’s loosen up, light banter welcome."  
> "Shift into serious tone, we’re dealing with

---

### 🧭 Tips

- **Use real roles.** Don’t make up titles — use the ones in `role_definitions.md`  
- **One thread per arc.** Don’t cram unrelated stuff together  
- **Narrate the pivot.** If the topic changes, say it clearly:  
  *“Switching to funding prep. New intent vector.”*  
- **Close threads cleanly.**
