# Team Rituals — CohereFrame

Every organization has a pulse.  
These are the rituals we use to keep it steady.  
You don’t have to join every one — but knowing the rhythm helps everyone move better.

## ⏳ Weekly Rhythms

- **Monday (Async) — Focus Reset**  
  Your agent will prompt you with a soft recap and ask what matters this week.  
  No meeting. Just presence.

- **Wednesday (Optional) — Cross-Team Drift**  
  Open drop-in window for anyone to share what they’re working on.  
  Not a stand-up. Not recorded. Just human drift space.

- **Friday (Async) — Week Reflection**  
  End-of-week auto-summary may be generated.  
  Agents will ask you to log one small moment that stood out.  
  No pressure.

## 🔄 Monthly Cadence

- **First Tuesday — Tone Check**  
  Light policy or direction drift reviewed.  
  Anyone can suggest a nudge to our handbook, rituals, or ops flow.

- **Last Thursday — Trust Pulse**  
  One-liner anonymous feedback via `internal_feedback.md`  
  Summary (no names) shared by agent runtime.

## 🛑 Silent Zones

- **No sync meetings on Wednesdays 12–4pm**  
  Deep work block. Agents won’t prompt you during this time.

- **No expected responses after 6pm local time**  
  The system is async. Rest is rhythm too.

## 🌕 Optional Cultural Flows

- **“Threadlight”**  
  You can drop a quote, image, or brief moment into `ops_feed.md` at week’s end.  
  No tags. No purpose. Just feeling the thread with others.

- **Silent Signal Day**  
  One day each quarter where no one sends messages.  
  Your agent holds your hand through the quiet.

# Rituals aren’t rules.
They’re what let the song go on without anyone needing to lead.
