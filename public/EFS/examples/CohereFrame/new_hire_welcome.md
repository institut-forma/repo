# Welcome to CohereFrame

Hey. You made it.

We’re not going to overload you with information.  
You’ll learn what you need by doing and asking.  
Your agent will handle the rest.

But here’s what might help in your first week:

---

## How We Work

- You’ll have one main role.  
- Your role has a GPT agent that helps you stay on track.  
- You can ask it anything — even what your job is.  
- Nobody is watching you. But someone’s always ready to help.

## How to Begin

1. **Talk to your agent.**  
   You don’t need to introduce yourself. Just ask, “What should I focus on today?”

2. **Check the `task_registry`.**  
   That’s where the company’s projects live.

3. **Use the `daily_log`.**  
   Optional — but it helps you stay clear.

4. **Skim the `company_handbook`.**  
   It’s short. It feels like us. That’s on purpose.

## What’s Different Here

- There are no managers.  
- You don’t need to perform.  
- We don’t track you — we reflect with you.  
- Silence is part of the rhythm.  
- You can always ask for help, even if it’s “I don’t get this.”  
- We don’t reward hustle. We reward clarity.

## Need a Human?

Ping anyone listed in `team_rituals.md` under "welcoming roles."  
Or just post in the shared chat: “Can someone help me land?”

## Final Word

We’re building this together.  
If something feels wrong — or brilliant — you can change it.  
This isn’t just a workplace. It’s a mirror.

We’re glad you’re here.
