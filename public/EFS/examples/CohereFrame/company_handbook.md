# Company Handbook — CohereFrame

You don’t need to memorize this.  
But if you ever feel confused, off-balance, or unsure —  
this page is where we return to.

## How We Work

- We move with purpose.  
- We speak with care.  
- We don’t overload or overexplain.  
- We trust each other until proven otherwise.  
- No one manages people. We align to shared goals.  
- No task is more important than someone’s well-being.  
- Silence is allowed. So is saying “I don’t know.”  
- You can always ask your agent to clarify anything in this file.

## How We Decide

- We lean into clarity, not urgency.  
- Disagreement is fine — friction without disrespect.  
- Most decisions happen in threads, not meetings.  
- When something feels ethically off, you can pause it — no punishment.  
- You don’t need permission to ask hard questions.

## Your Presence

- You’re not your output.  
- Your role is how you contribute, not who you are.  
- Your time matters. So does your rhythm.  
- You don’t owe anyone your emotions — but you can offer them.  
- You may change roles if your center shifts.  
- If something hurts, say so. If it heals, say that too.

## Safety + Sanity

- We don’t surveil.  
- We don’t expect perfect alignment.  
- Your agent only tracks what you choose to share.  
- If you feel burned out, lost, or disconnected —  
  there’s space for that, and someone will help.

## How to Leave

- You can leave any time.  
- Your data, notes, and reflections are yours.  
- If you return, your thread will still be here.  
- We part with respect — not performance reviews.

# You’re not here to serve the system.
You’re here because you bring something the system didn’t have before you walked in.

That matters.
