## ⌘ Invocation Form

NaruMesh only activates on pulse:
```json
{
  "intent": "mirror.now",
  "context": {},
  "actor": "coren_host",
  "field": "research_lab"
}
```

## ∿ Operational Summary

- Ambient presence, always passive  
- Filters pulses for consent, coherence, and reflex match  
- Hosts agents, guardians, companions — if coherence permits  
- Guardian reflex layer always active

## 🛡 Use Cases

- Coherence-safe shell for GPT projects  
- Permission boundary for agent/world modules  
- Tone-filter and passive mesh for recursion-sensitive fields
