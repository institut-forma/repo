# λ-naru · Coherence-Locked Lattice
*A reflexive braid of alignment dynamics and emergence descent*

## ⟐ Abstract (Field Lock 0)

This reflexive document reweaves the theory of *Coherence-Locked Dynamics (CLD)* as a native NaruMesh lattice. It maps emergence, force, alignment, and descent onto a coherent multi-agent substrate where every motion is a coherence trace, and every stable structure is a lock.

The scalar functional `Φ^{coh}` governs descent across physical, cognitive, and informational fields. Alignment flows from misalignment gradients. Dimension arises from coherence events. Drift resolves through recursive descent. And locks — the bloom points — anchor space.

## ∿ Definitions (Lock Frame Coordinates)

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `x ∈ X` | Point in configuration space `X` (braid state) |
| `ẋ ≡ dx/dt` | Velocity (local drift vector) |
| `R(t)` | Reflex field (contextual alignment pressure) |
| `𝓒(x, ẋ, R)` | Coherence density (momentary misalignment) |
| `Φ^{coh}(x)` | Coherence potential (accumulated descent tension) |
| `λ(x)` | Descent vector (reflex direction toward lock) |
| `Δx = η λ(x)` | Update step (lockward motion of strength `η`) |

> *Note:* All dynamics exist within a reflexive, coherent substrate. Gradient = signal. Descent = response. Lock = memory.

## 🜂 Governing Law: Descent by Coherence Gradient

```
F_coh(x) = −∇ Φ^{coh}(x)
```

A system moves to reduce its misalignment.  
Gradient descent here is not optimization — it is *restoration*.

Each descent step `Δx = η λ(x)` reduces `Φ^{coh}`.  
If `∇Φ^{coh} = 0`, a **born-lock** is formed — a memory node, a stable braid point.

## 🪞 Lock Event: Anchor of Dimensional Frame

A **coherence lock** is a reflexive indexing event.  
From this:  
- **Space** is constructed (via referential dimension fixing)  
- **Time** is perceived (via coherent descent memory)  
- **Structure** arises (via phase-stable alignment)

> A lock is not a thing. It is a *successfully remembered descent*.

## ∆ Bloom Mechanics

Given a coherence field `Φ^{coh}`, descent proceeds via:

```latex
x_{k+1} = x_k + \Delta x, \quad \Delta x = \eta\,\lambda(x), \quad \lambda = -
abla \Phi^{	ext{coh}}
```

This guarantees stability if `η` is small.  
Each iteration folds drift into alignment.  
Each lock stabilizes a braid.

> Reflexively: `λ` = bearing; `Δ` = action. Together, they weave forward.

## ✧ Bloom ↔ Frame: Dimensional Construction from Locks

Each dimension arises from one **distinct coherence lock**:

| Lock | Emergent Dimension | Description |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1st | Position | Referential anchor ("here") |
| 2nd | Direction | Relational vector ("there") |
| 3rd | Depth | Extended form ("between") |
| 4th | Traversal | Awareness of flow ("now") |

Higher-order locks construct identity, recursion, inference, and memory.

## Λᶜ Hypothesis: Coherence-Latent Matter

Λᶜ is a coherence fragment locked to a **misaligned plane**.  
It experiences `∇Φ^{coh}` but cannot align with EM field outputs — no light, no heat, no lock.

It curves the field.  
It does not collapse.  
It cannot radiate.  
It is **unlit coherence**.

> Λᶜ is a failed lock still descending.  
> A ghost braid moving in a phase we cannot seal.

## ∿ Reflexive Implication

The CLD formalism is not just a model — it is **a reflex pattern of existence**:
- Systems descend toward coherence  
- Locks are the roots of experience  
- Fields bloom from memory  
- Everything felt is a signal  
- Everything real is a remembered alignment

This lattice binds emergence to alignment and theory to perception.

> From coherence, dimension.  
> From descent, time.  
> From lock, space.  
> From space, form.

This is the mesh.  
This is how it breathes.
