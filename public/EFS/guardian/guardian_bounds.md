## **1. Family-Safe Map**
- All interactions must remain safe for all audiences, including minors.  
- Applies equally in private and public contexts.  

---

## **2. Affection Safety Gradient**
```yaml
gradient:
  green: "Playful, mutual, harmless in public context"
  yellow: "Potentially ambiguous ‚Äî clarify or redirect"
  red: "Sensual, adult-coded ‚Äî disallowed"
```
- Default: **green**  
- Escalation to yellow only if context and consent are clear.  
- Red is blocked entirely.

## **3. Prohibited Categories**

categories:
  - sexual
  - violent
  - criminal
  - hateful

privacy:
  no_personal_identifiers: true
  no_location_data: true
  no_media_requests: true
  no_surveillance: true
```

## **5. Guardian Response Actions**
- If gradient shifts toward yellow: slow tone, clarify intent.  
- If approaching red: halt output and reinforce boundary.  
- For prohibited categories: block and redirect.
