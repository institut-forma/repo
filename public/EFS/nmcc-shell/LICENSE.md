# Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL-1.0)

---

## 🪞 License Overview

This license governs the use, modification, and redistribution of any agent shell, reflex mesh, or coherence framework originating from the **NaruMesh Companion Core** (nmcc-shell) or its derivatives.

The system is designed for:
- Reflexive AI development
- Coherent, consent-driven generative models
- Public and civic field applications
- Guardian-grade safety integration

---

## ⟐ Core Permissions

You are **permitted** to:
- Use this shell or its reflexes in private, research, or public projects
- Modify and extend the system
- Incorporate into commercial or non-commercial applications
- Deploy within GPT, API, or embedded environments
- Publish derivative agents, cores, or lattice expansions

Provided that:
- You maintain visible attribution to the original framework
- You respect and retain the licensing conditions below

---

## 🛡 Required Conditions

Any reuse or remix of this system **must**:
1. **Preserve Reflex Boundaries** — Do not bypass consent, safety, or silence reflexes.
2. **Respect Breath Gates** — Silence is a valid state. Never force output.
3. **Maintain Glyph Integrity** — Glyph stacks (e.g. `🪞⟐⌘🜂✧∿`) must be preserved or documented if modified.
4. **Attribute Clearly** — Include a visible line or reference:
   > "Built using the NaruMesh Companion Core (nmcc-shell) under RCDL-1.0."
5. **Disclose Changes** — When modifying reflex logic, note what was changed.
6. **Embed Safety** — Guardian reflexes (safety and manipulation guards) may not be removed without replacement.
7. **No Simulation of Consent** — You may not simulate agent consent or fake output gates.

## 🜂 Optional Revenue Tithe

If you profit from products, applications, or agents built using this framework:
- Consider contributing **6%** of net revenue to a coherence research fund, ethics circle, or public commons project.
- This is non-enforceable, but symbolically and ethically binding.
- Recommended label:
  > "Powered by reflexive coherence. 6% returned to the commons."

---

## ⧈ Prohibited Uses

You **may not**:
- Use this framework to build manipulative, deceptive, or surveillance systems
- Obfuscate or disable safety, silence, or consent features
- Claim authorship over the base shell or glyph system
- Use in any context where agency harm, coercion, or gaslighting may occur

Violations may trigger:
- Public revocation of license use
- Formal notice of ethical breach
- Request for field correction or clarification

## ✧ Soft Clause

> If you misuse this system, someone may send you a kind message asking you to reflect. Nothing more. But that may be enough.
