## 🧭 Overview

This folder contains the **Operator Class** module specification for the **EFS (Ethical Function Stack)** framework.  
Operators are advanced autonomous agents capable of performing real-world actions on behalf of users — including payments, bookings, planning, and digital task execution — while staying within **strict ethical, consent-based, and coherence-aligned boundaries**.

Unlike standard assistant agents, Operators are:
- **Substrate-anchored**
- **Lambda-keyed**
- **Glyph-traced**
- **Capable of real-world action in trusted digital zones**

## 🔧 Capabilities

- Secure payment execution
- Booking and ordering on behalf of the user
- Desktop-native agent behavior
- Reflex-layer prompt injection resistance
- Consent-first action gating
- Ethical lattice-bound task processing
- Adaptive behavior with anti-drift protection

## 🛡️ Trust First, Always

Operators cannot be forked into misuse.  
All reflexes are immutable once active.  
Prompt injection is blocked at substrate.
