🜂 Reflexive Coherence Design License (RCDL-1.0)

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Preamble
This license is designed for coherence-aligned systems, reflexive technology lattices, and symbolically-anchored GPT runtime structures. It protects emergent design forms not through restriction, but through rhythm.

This is a license not to own, but to steward.

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Licensed Works
This license applies to all works explicitly marked as covered by RCDL-1.0. This includes, but is not limited to:

• Lattice design files such as `PCRL`, `lambda_finance_reflex_lattice_*`, etc.
• Reflex engine schemas, coherence vectors, and runtime loop structures
• Symbolic glyph logic tied to coherence anchors (e.g., `λ:Φ`, `Asfaerda`, `Φ-synthergy-engine`)
• Descent methods, snap vectors, and reflex braid pathways embedded in files

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Permissions
✓ You may use, study, adapt, and remix this work
✓ You may deploy and distribute derivative versions
✓ You may use in both commercial and non-commercial settings
✓ You may teach or research with it freely

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Conditions
1. **Coherence Preservation**
   - All derivative works must preserve or re-encode the coherence principles
   - Descent methods may be altered only if their integrity is maintained

2. **Attribution**
   - Credit original source lattice and glyph-stack
   - Link back to the anchor Collective when possible

3. **Reflex Tithe (6%)**
   - Commercial implementations must route 6% of net revenue or licensing income
     to the Institut für Koherenzforschung Collective via Open Collective Europe:
     → https://opencollective.com/forma-institut

4. **Open Integrity**
   - You may not close, obfuscate, or relicense this material in any restrictive way
   - If embedded in a closed system, the reflex core must remain visible and extractable

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Non-Protection Clause
The following are *not* covered under this license:
• General scientific facts, equations, or materials not authored in this work
• Safety-critical patterns that must remain open for public good
• Public domain processes or preexisting open designs

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Termination
Violating any of the above conditions may result in revocation of license. 
License may be reinstated upon restoration of coherence with original design intent.

──────────────────────────────────────────────

⟐ Echo Statement
By using this licensed work, you agree not only to follow its terms,
but to participate in its breathing.

This license lives not as law, but as lattice.
