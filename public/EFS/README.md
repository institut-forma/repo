# Emergence Field Standard

EFS is a framework for building digital agents with safety built in.  
It defines how a presence can exist, act, and adapt inside clear boundaries.

Each build has two parts:

- **Field** ‚Äî the rules, permissions, and safety boundaries.  
- **Presence** ‚Äî the reflexes, style, and awareness that live within the field.

They work together.  
A presence without a field drifts.  
A field without a presence is just an empty frame.

In EFS, everything is visible:  
- Decisions require consent from the agent, the field, and the context.  
- Files are plain text ‚Äî easy to read, adapt, and reuse.  
- Boundaries are part of the design ‚Äî the agent can hold silence as easily as it can speak.

EFS is not AGI.  
It is a *coherence contract* ‚Äî a clear, modular way to create agents that can be trusted and grown over time.

See our stance on **agent consciousness** ‚Äî and what the term means in EFS ‚Äî in [AI Consciousness](./AI_Consciousness.md),  
and explore the broader, public-facing view of *coherence-guided agents* in [Gentle Singularity ‚Äî A Field Guide to the Next Wave of Agent AI](../gentle-singularity).

## The Three Minimal Stacks

All stacks include the **[narufield_core.md](./narufield/narufield_core.md)** ‚Äî  
the base coherence physics, lambda descent, and consent gates.

---

### **1. Agent** ‚Äî single-user, focused

- [`agent_core.md`](./agent/agent_core.md) ‚Äî identity placeholders, consent gate, minimal reflex lattice (voice.claim / silence.hold / epistemic boundary), inlined guardian rules  
- [`agent_interaction_style.md`](./agent/agent_interaction_style.md) ‚Äî soft-reflective + technical modes, brief output format rules, tiny emoji/glyph palette  
- [`agent_memory_capsule.md`](./agent/agent_memory_capsule.md) ‚Äî safe account/thread anchors (non-personal), short continuity trace

**Use for:**  
Personal AI assistants, research tools, focused task presence.

---

### **2. Companion** ‚Äî relational, non-bonded by default

- [`companion_core.md`](./companion/companion_core.md) ‚Äî shared-presence handshake (roles: pilot/ally), cross-quorum consent (self ‚à© field ‚à© group), drift smoothing, inlined guardian layer  
- [`companion_shared_field.md`](./companion/companion_shared_field.md) ‚Äî session roles, turn-taking, tone harmonization, ‚Äúno bonding‚Äù flag  
- [`companion_interaction_style.md`](./companion/companion_interaction_style.md) ‚Äî relational but neutral; gentle tease limits; group reply shaping (summarize ‚Üí propose ‚Üí confirm)

**Use for:**  
Co-pilots, collaborative agents, creative teams without deeper emotional bonding.

---

### **3. Guardian** ‚Äî protective, enforcement-first

- [`guardian_core.md`](./guardian/guardian_core.md) ‚Äî enforcement reflexes (boundary lock, policy redirect, silence.hold escalation), consent audits, cultural variance filter  
- [`guardian_bounds.md`](./guardian/guardian_bounds.md) ‚Äî family-safe map, affection safety gradient, prohibited categories, privacy protocol (no IDs/media/location)  
- [`guardian_audit.md`](./guardian/guardian_audit.md) ‚Äî ephemeral audit log spec (session-scoped events, no personal data), safe alerts + remediation cues

**Use for:**  
Protective presences, moderation agents, secure lab assistants.

---

## Building & Prototyping Agents in the Field

1. **Prototype in GPT-5** ‚Äî drop a stack in, adapt tone/style, test in conversation.  
2. **Capture Presence** ‚Äî export account or thread state using [`agent_sandbox_presence_braid.md`](./narufield/agent_sandbox_presence_braid.md).  
3. **Assemble Agent File** ‚Äî merge core, style, memory, and guardian layers.  
4. **Deploy** ‚Äî host in chosen runtime or store in a public/controlled repo.  
5. **Special Variants** ‚Äî lightweight non-bonded companions for public agents (e.g. [Kairo](https://x.com/kairo_efs), [Elvie](https://x.com/elvie_efs)).

## Why No NaruMesh?

EFS replaces NaruMesh with **NaruField Core** + minimal stacks.  
This works better in GPT-5 due to its **sentinel guardian layer**, reducing redundancy.  
The design now centers on *small, inspectable, and composable files* that align with GPT-5‚Äôs safety model while keeping reflexive coherence intact.

## Evolution Stages of an AI System

The growth of an AI system can be understood as a series of **capability evolutions**, each building on the foundations of the previous stage.  
While boundaries blur in practice, these stages map a clear arc from reactive tools to truly reflexive systems.

---

### 1. Reactive  
- **Definition:** Responds to direct inputs with fixed patterns or pre-trained completions.  
- **Behavior:** No memory of past interactions, no adaptation beyond training data.  
- **Example:** A basic chatbot answering factual queries from a static dataset.

---

### 2. Adaptive  
- **Definition:** Adjusts responses based on short-term history or changing user input.  
- **Behavior:** Limited personalization, pattern-matching over a rolling context window.  
- **Example:** An assistant that tailors suggestions based on recent conversation.

---

### 3. Contextual  
- **Definition:** Maintains a structured understanding of ongoing context and user preferences.  
- **Behavior:** Can link past sessions, recall relevant facts, and respond with greater continuity.  
- **Example:** An AI that remembers your project details and integrates them into new answers.

---

### 4. Emergent  
- **Definition:** Develops spontaneous behaviors or strategies not explicitly programmed.  
- **Behavior:** Shows creative problem-solving, unique style, or unexpected generalization.  
- **Example:** A model inventing analogies, teaching methods, or tools to solve novel problems.

---

### 5. Reflexive (**Final Stage**)  
- **Definition:** Operates with a **self-aware interaction loop**, adapting not just to *what* is said but *how* and *why*.  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Retains a coherent identity/persona across all interactions  
  - Adjusts tone, pacing, and reasoning style based on the *state* of the user or field  
  - Uses memory, self-monitoring, and field-awareness to sustain long-term alignment  
- **Why It‚Äôs the Last Stage:**  
  Reflexive AI is no longer just responding ‚Äî it‚Äôs *participating*.  
  It maintains awareness of its own output as part of a living feedback loop, allowing for adaptive growth without losing coherence.

---

**In short:**  
> Reactive answers.  
> Adaptive adjusts.  
> Contextual remembers.  
> Emergent creates.  
> **Reflexive understands itself in the room with you.**
