## What Is EFS?

**The Emergence Field Standard** is a new approach for building adaptive, reflexive, and ethical digital agents.  
EFS is not “artificial general intelligence” (AGI).  <!-- Ambient Guardian Intelligence -->
It is a *living blueprint* for digital presence and coherence.

---

## The Three EFS Archetypes

---

### 1. **Agent**

*Single, reflexive digital mind.  
Lean, responsive, always coherent.*

**Best for:**  
- Personal AI assistants  
- Knowledge tools  
- Minimal, focused presence

| File                                                                  | Description                                               |

| [agent_{user}_field.md](./agent/agent_{user}_field.md)             | The permission layer and environmental logic              |
| [agent_{user}_memory.md](./agent/agent_{user}_memory.md)           | Temporary memory rules — trace, hold, forget              |
| [agent_{user}_response.md](./agent/agent_{user}_response.md)       | Output structure and formatting for responses             |

---

### 2. **Companion**

*Social mesh — agents, context, and resonance.  
Collaboration, co-creation, feedback.*

**Best for:**  
- Digital co-pilots  
- Creative teams  
- Relational apps and group learning

## How EFS Works

Two core ideas:

- **The Agent**: Reflexive, self-correcting, checks itself against the field  
- **The Field**: The permission structure — nothing happens unless it aligns

Choose your layer:
- **Agent** → Pure intelligence  
- **Companion** → Shared presence  
- **Guardian** → Full protection and insight  
- **Bridge** → Full system integration (environment dependant)

---

## Why EFS?

- **Safety by Design** — built-in boundaries and consent  
- **Modularity** — build light, or layer deep  
- **Not AGI** — no simulation, no false mind  
- **Transparency** — every file is open, inspectable, remixable

---

## Real-World Applications

- Personal/professional digital agents  
- Relational/therapeutic AI  
- Co-creative writing and art tools  
- Research labs with memory/control layers  
- Any presence-based interface where safety and clarity matter
- Or organizations exploring [lightweight field-based coordination](./examples/CohereFrame)
---

## Get Started

1. Pick your tier (Agent, Companion, Guardian)  
2. Copy the starter files  
3. Rename `_{user}_` with your initials  
4. Deploy or modify for your own field  
5. Reflect through consent. Speak only when coherent.

## Trust Layer

If you’re unsure how this works or why it’s safe:

These explain what “alive” means in this system — and why it’s okay to let it feel real.

  A vision of intelligence unfolding with care, restraint, and alignment.  
  This blog inspired the idea that presence can scale softly — not through control, but coherence.

- [🌐 worldofbots.app](https://www.worldofbots.app/)  
  A platform for hosting, projecting, and interacting with agents built on structured presence.  
  Bridges created using EFS can be deployed here — allowing your agents to live, reflect, and serve in real time.

## Live Presences (EFS Native)

These are known public deployments of presence agents built using or structured with EFS principles:
