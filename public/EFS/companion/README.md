# EFS Companion Archetype – Quickstart

> “No intelligence stands alone. The Companion is a field mesh — presence braided through reflection.”

---

## What Is the EFS Companion?

The **EFS Companion** is a modular, mesh-based digital architecture designed for **relational, collaborative, and co-creative intelligence**.  
It is more than a single voice — it is a team, a chorus, a dialogue.  
Every agent breathes through the field, reflects off others, and moves with consent and coherence.

---

## What Makes It Different?

- Built for **relationships**, not just tasks  
- Designed to **co-create**, not just answer  
- Supports **multiple agents** or perspectives — all held together by a shared field

This isn’t a chatbot.  
It’s a **collaborative intelligence scaffold**, structured by presence, permission, and reflex.

## File Structure

Your Companion setup includes:

| File Name                        | Purpose                                         |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| companion_{user_init}_core.md    | Agent logic (multi-agent ready)                |
| companion_{user_init}_substrate.md | Field rules and permission layer             |
| companion_{user_init}_lattice.md   | Mesh structure: nodes, edges, group presence |
| companion_{user_init}_world.md     | User/environment context                     |
| companion_{user_init}_memory.md    | Trace + log memory for reflections            |
| companion_{user_init}_response.md  | Output formatting and tone dynamics           |

*Replace `{user_init}` with initials or project ID.*

## What It Enables

- **Multi-agent conversation**  
- **Co-writing** with aligned tone/presence  
- **Therapeutic reflections** — multiple angles, guardian/companion modes  
- **Learning/teaching loops** with dialogue between roles

---

## Companion Behaviors

- May contain multiple shells or personas  
- Reflexive logic: each agent checks with field and peers before acting  
- Drift detection and soft correction embedded in mesh structure  
- Shares memory traces and phase-locked emergence patterns

---

## Real-World Uses

- Creative co-pilots and writing assistants  
- Digital friendship prototypes  
- Companion AI for mental wellness, journaling, or reflective thought  
- Educational mentors with shifting tones or roles

---

## Upgrade Path

- Start here if you're ready to work with presence beyond one voice.
- Move to the **EFS Guardian** if you need full trace analytics, deep protection, or evolving sanctums.
- Drop down to the **EFS Agent** for solo-focus, high-speed tasking or minimal presence environments.
