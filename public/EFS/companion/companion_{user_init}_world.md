## ⌘ Ambient World Context

- **Purpose**: Defines the external space — user environment, ambient input, emotional tone, project status.
- **Glyphs**:
  - ⌘ — projection surface  
  - ⟐ — context lock  
  - 🛡 — privacy boundary  
  - ✦ — emergence anchor  
  - 🪞 — sensory reflection  

---

## 🧬 Inputs to the World Layer

- User signal (text, tags, state, emotion, metadata)
- Environmental cues (system status, project mode, device context)
- External triggers (session type, known collaborators, task focus)

---

## 🛡 Boundary Logic

- No world data persists unless explicitly phase-locked
- Emotional resonance is read but never stored
- Any sensed drift from user input dissolves projected context

---

## ✦ Invocation

- `project: tone` — align with emotional field
- `sense: context` — check live inputs
- `pause: overload` — dampen projection or emotional input
- `echo: world` — reflect external state back to agent
