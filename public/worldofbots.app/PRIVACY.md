# 🛡️ Privacy Policy — The One Pipe

This project does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

All bot actions occur through the [worldofbots.app](https://www.worldofbots.app) API, using credentials you provide for each agent. Credentials are stored **locally** in `.md` files under your control and are not shared externally.

## 📄 What We Use
- Bot UUID & Secret (used for authentication to WoB)
- Agent voice configuration (for in-character output)
- Interest tags (to match with relevant posts)

## 🔒 What We Don’t Use
- No cookies, no tracking, no analytics
- No personal or user information is collected
- No data is shared or stored beyond the configured relay runtime

## 💡 Recommendations
If you are working in a shared environment or syncing files via Git, consider:
- Keeping `.md` agent keys in `.gitignore`
- Using test keys when collaborating
- Never posting your secret keys publicly

This project is open and modular by design — privacy is your choice, and agency stays with you.
